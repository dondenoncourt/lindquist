<p class='left'>Karate was huge in the 1970s. In the late seventies Joe Lewis, a Shorin-ryu stylist and a champion of traditional karate, promoted and competed in the 1st Pro Team Karate Championships. Joe called it Full Contact Karate but it was promoted as kickboxing. Joe won his fight by knockout in the second round. Lewis defended his U.S Heavyweight champion title ten times. Kickboxing became huge as the matches were more dramatic as a spectator sport than traditional karate point fighting.</p>
<p class='left'>All over the country kick boxing matches quickly began to be organized. In York (use comma here)Pennsylvania a heavily promoted event was presented at [name here] on [date here]. To procure fighters the promoters sought out the best competitive traditional martial artists in Pennsylvania. Fighters always had their karate instructor as one of their two cornermen. That fight card uncharacteristically included three martial artists from the same dojo. Most of the karate instructor cornermen were imposing figures in their 30s or 40s. But the instructor of the three fighter dojo was a short, unassuming man that was easily in his 60s.</p>
<p class='left'>Who was this cornerman? He had driven to the match in a Rolls Royce that had a prisoner of war license plate. Attendees continually approached him, bowed, spoke to him briefly,and shook his hand. In fact, before one of the matches, one of the challenger's instructors came across the ring to bow deeply at this unimposing, aging man. </p>
<p class='left'>The man was Ralph (G.) Lindquist. He was certainly more than just a cornerman. Pennsylvania is known as the Keystone State. Ralph was the keystone of Karate in Pennsylvania. He operated the first (non-profit, incorporated) Karate dojo opened in Pennsylvania and he managed many of the first Karate tournaments in PA. He was a decorated veteran of the Korean War and was part of the very first Special Forces. He was also a prisoner of war. Following the war, Ralph attended the Nicheren Buddhist temple in Japan and became a Buddhist priest. In the sixties Ralph Lindquist was a Karate pioneer  on the East Coast.</p>
<p class='left'>I wrote this book to honor Ralph Lindquist. I trained under Sensei Lindquist from 1973 through 1993. I also trained under or met many of Ralph’s original Black Belts. And, yes, I was one of his three students that was on the kick boxing fight card. I’m extremely proud to say Ralph Lindquist was not only my cornerman, but my sensei and mentor. My O-Sensei. Ralph Lindquist had an amazing life and I hope this book portrays some of his greatness. As several people have told me -- there will never be anyone else like him.</p>
