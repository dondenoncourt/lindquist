<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

<p class="left">I need to thank everyone I spoke about in this book. Some were sensei (such as Vito Coviello, Bill Dollinger, and Dick Rupert) and some were training partners (Dave Bretz and Jim Kotzman).</p>
<p class="left">But a special thanks to Tim Messersmith for tracking down the real Charles Miller in a state full of Charles Millers and accosting him (unannouced) at his home to verify his identity.</p>
<p class="left">I was at the point of giving up on writing this book until I began having dozens of conversations with Sensei Charles Miller. Without those conversations, this book would not have been completed. Thank you Sensei Miller for provided wonderful information and editing the book.</p>
<p class="left">I also want to give specific thanks to Vito Coviello for participating with me in a long series of detailed emails and for editing the entire book via Google Docs.</p>
<p class="left">And finally I want to thank the millenials, Brian and Michael Sheffield, for sustaining the tradition of Ralph Lindquist style training thus continuing the Ralph Lindquist story.</p>
