  <h1>Chapter 9: Bretz, Kotz, Denon</h1>
</center>

<p class='left'>Attending class at Ralph Lindquist’s Harrisburg Isshinryu dojo was a magical experience. I typically descended into a deep state of concentration. The world, during those two hours, consisted only of Sensei’s class.  I traveled from York to Ralph’s Harrisburg dojo two nights a week from 1976 to 1982. Sensei often had myself and David Bretz — the hot shot brown belts we were — lead class. Ralph trained everyone to be an instructor from your first green stripe on a white belt to black belt. </p>
<p class='left'>Sensei Lindquist was a master and taught karate-do, the way of karate. I recall Ralph speaking with the mother of a youthful student. She was obviously a little confused about all this kicking, punching, and potential for bodily harm. Ralph had a gift of speaking at people’s level of understanding. He never spoke above anyone. In Buddhism this is called “skillful means” which refers to an enlightened person's ability to tailor their message to a specific audience. Sensei said to this mother: <i>“There’s got to be more to this than just self defense. It’s too much work. Otherwise we’d just put a nail through a stick and carry it around.”</i> Ralph could have gone into great detail about Karate-do and certainly could have written books about it. But this mother got that feeling from Sensei (as did most whom he spoke with) and accepted that there was more to karate than just kicking and punching. </p>
<p class='left'>Meanwhile, Dave Bretz, myself, and Jim Kotzman were teaching students, metaphorically, how to drive nails through sticks and whack people. We were hardcore martial artists that visited other dojos and competed at tournaments. But, when our contemporaries from these other schools opened their own dojos, we continued being a part of Sensei Lindquists dojo as he centered us. We were teaching karate, O-Sensei Lindquist was teaching life. </p>
<p class='left'>When Bretz and I were brown belts, Sensei would begin class. He’d lead through calisthenics and basic punches and kicks. Then he’d call Dave and I up to the front of class, bow to us, and move to the back. In the back of class he would often perform the techniques Dave and I were teaching and assist the underbelts. Oftentimes he’d pull an underbelt to the side and work on the kata that the student was currently learning. Would that I could go back in time, I’d instigate more personal training time with O-Sensei. All of us would. </p>
<p class='left'>Before class I’d sometimes be working on a technique that I had learned from one of my Taekwondo or Shotokan training partners. Ralph would watch with curiosity, then, when he led class, he’d have us do an improved revised version of that technique. When I received my black belt Ralph said that I had brought some confusion to the school. He also said <i>“When something stops growing and adapting, that’s the definition of death.”</i> Sensei was constantly evaluating technique and making alterations to kata to adapt to greater understanding. </p>
<p class='left'>I recall when Jake Stoss, one of Sensei’s black belts from the sixties, visited. We were working on mae geri and Jake said: <i>“Ralph has the best front kick in karate.”</i> A half hour later we were working on mawashi geri and Jake said: <i>“Ralph has the best round kick in karate.”</i> He was right both times. Sensei had developed what we called the “rip kick.” He would torque the ball of his foot on impact to focus the power in injurious ways. Me? I had plenty of high flouting kicks. I could do full splits and there was nothing Van Damme could do that I couldn't. But Ralph’s mae and mawashi geri were devastating. Jake (who was, like Ralph, of short stature) recounted a story of a discussion of high kicks with Sensei. Sensei said to Jake: <i>“If you want to kick someone in the face, use your fist.”</i> When I competed in kickboxing, I did none of my fancy kicks, opting for my version of Sensei’s rip kicks. The audiences were not impressed with my torso height rip kicks but my opponents dropped their hands to avert them. Then, yes, as Sensei suggested to Jake, I kicked them in their face with a gloved fist.</p>

<p class='left'>After Dave Bretz and I obtained our black belts — or took them as Ralph said: <i>“No one should be given a black belt but rather take it”</i> — we started in the front of class with Sensei. Sensei always started the class with a formal bow to the class. Then he’d turn to us and bow to signify we should proceed. Sometimes he’d stay up front for ten to twenty minutes but he’d always move to the back for personalized attention to underbelts. Ralph would always end the class. He’d sit in the samurai kneeling posture. The class would do the same. We’d meditate for several minutes. Sensei would touch his forehead to the ground in a respectful bow, pop up, without using his hands, and bow again from a standing position. And the class was over. I now know that I got more out of O-Sensei Lindquist’s closing 2 minutes of meditation than I did from the 2 hour class. Something deep and, well, magical.</p>
<p class='left'>I’m calling the late seventies and eighties the era of Bretz, Kotzman, and Denoncourt. We led class and we trained and sparred lower belts till they became good (or great) fighters themselves. An example of a great fighter was Michael Einsig, who went by the moniker of Iron Mike as a successful full contact kickboxer (with Kotzman as his trainer). We competed regularly, and successfully, at tournaments and kickboxing events. We were sensei. Our master was O-Sensei-sama Ralph Lindquist.</p>

<h2>Bretz</h2>
<p class='left'>David Bretz was a gifted athlete. In high school he was named first team for Pennsylvania’s All-State football and he was also a champion wrestler. When I was a sixteen year old attending classes at Ralph’s Harrisburg dojo, Bretz was one of those that regularly beat the crap out of me. Actually, it was just bruising of the chest, ribs, and arms with an occasional bloody lip or nose. A few years later, after sparring regularly with some locally competitive Shotokan and Tae Kwon Do martial artists, I once again began to visit the Lindquist dojo. I sparred Bretz and, in his words, he couldn’t touch me as he couldn’t get past my kicks. We became training partners and close friends. He’d come down on Saturday mornings to work out at Jim Dohm’s Health Club, where I was an instructor and manager. We’d do Karate training for two hours then lift weights for another hour or two.</p>
<p class='left'>We had an open workout format and a steady stream of local Karateka regularly stopped by to spar. Dave also trained under one of the best boxing trainers in Harrisburg (who went by the nickname of Sweetcakes.) My kicks were spot on but Bretz trained my hands. At the tournaments, Dave would always line up with the toughest looking competitor for kumite.</p>
<p class='left'>There was one tournament where O-Sensei Ralph Lindquist and Sensei Ron Lawrence both attended. They judged black belt kata. I took second and Bretz took third. The guy that took first place was truly amazing. Bretz tied for third so he had to do another kata, and took third. Later Sensei made very sure to tell me that Bretz's second kata was better than my first. A comment I took as a compliment as Dave and I were kata training partners.</p>

<div class="caption">Ron Lawrence and Ralph Lindquist judging Black Belt competition</div>

<p class='left'>Bretz had been a tough guy before training in the martial arts. One night he was at a bar and a guy challenged Dave. Dave slammed him up against the wall and told him: <i>“Don’t mess with me.”</i> Later that night, as Dave was leaving the bar, the guy was waiting outside the door and whalloped Dave on his nose with a queue ball. Dave was in the hospital for weeks.</p>
<p class='left'>For years Dave, who always frequented bars, looked for this man. Five years or so later, after boxing training, a bit of Judo, and a Lindquist black belt, Dave spotted the guy at a bar. He walked up to him and said: <i>"Remember me?"</i> The guy must have recognized Dave because he immediately took a swing at him. Big mistake. Bretz had this looping overhand right. He wanted you to block it as he’d torque his elbow up and drive down with his massive forearms into, thoughtfully and kindly, your chest. I knew that punch quite well (having been hit with it often while it was encased in a padded glove.) That guy didn’t know that punch. Dave hit him once, not so kindly though, in the face. The guy collapsed. Dave left. </p>
<p class='left'>The police put out an all points bulletin (APB) for the arrest of Dave and his "gang" that beat the hell out of the poor guy in the hospital. From the bruising on his face, the police figured the victim had been punched and kicked multiple times. That gang was but one of Dave’s punches. The police picked Dave up but soon let him go after they discovered there were multiple warrants out for Mr. Queball — who turned out to be not a fine and upstanding member of society. The police then inquired of Dave where he had received his martial arts training.</p>
<p class='left'>Lindquist’s classes on Monday and Thursday nights with Dave and Jim were the bastion of my training. Dave and I typically led class while Ralph gave one-on-one instruction in the back. </p>

<p class='left'>Here’s a note Patty Lipsett sent me about our classes:</p>
<p class='left'><i><i>“I remember when we started you and Dave ran class, alternating techniques and the class just died trying to keep up.”</i></i></p>
<p class='left'><i><i>“Best shape I have ever been in!”</i></i></p>
<p class='left'><i><i>“One night Jack and I drove home after class, we were too tired to climb out of the van. We sat for over 10 minutes not able to move.”</i></i></p>
<p class='left'><i><i>“‘Yup, time to go in’ ...(no movement),  ‘let’s go’ (no movement), and our gi’s were soaked with sweat and reeked. We had to wash with bleach to get the smell out.”</i></i></p>
<p class='left'><i><i>“‘Those were the days!”</i></i></p>

<img src="../images/ch 9 bretz kicking Ron Ralph watching.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Bretz kicking the hand bag held by Ron Lawrence, Ralph watching</div>

<p class='left'>Despite Dave’s punching prowess, when he sparred he typically tried to score with kicks. Dave knew he could take out most anybody, at any time, with a punch. My punches never got as good as Dave’s and his kicks never got as good as mine but both of us evolved into better martial artists because of each other’s strengths. </p>
<p class='left'>Dave had another incident at the dojo. Some idiot came to the YMCA literally looking for a fight. He first went to the Judo class but had no takers. Then he came to our class and billerently hollered: <i>“Anyone want to fight.”</i> Bretz walked to the back of the room and the guy assumed a wrestling stance. Bretz front kicked him and, as he bounced off the wall, Bretz began pummeling him with punches. Sensei Lindquist cautiously tried to pull Bretz off the guy but was concerned about receiving a wild haymaker himself. When Bretz stopped, the fellow quickly ran off. The guy had no idea Dave was pulling his punches!</p>
<p class='left'>When I first began working out with David Bretz, he was a plumber for the railroad. But, like most Lindquist students, he continually improved himself both in and out of the dojo. He started a successful lawn care business, with multiple trucks, and garnered contracts from large companies. He went back to college and got a degree in engineering. He then had a successful career building bridges for the state of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class='left'>Dave had to have spinal surgery in his neck when he was maybe forty years old. Sensei told me a story about him visiting Dave at the hospital. Ralph was helping Dave do a tentative walk around the hallways, to become comfortable walking again. Ralph said there was a man and wife arguing and Dave was getting upset with the guy. He told Sensei he was going to do something. Ralph asked him: <i>“What are you going to do?”</i> And Dave responded: <i>“Just push me into him. I’ll take care of it.”</i> Luckily for the arguing husband, Ralph didn’t lob Dave at him.</p>
<p class='left'>Conversely, Dave told me at Sensei’s funeral that in his last days, Sensei let Dave know that he didn’t want to be visited while he was at the hospital. Dave said that he didn’t care, he still visited him. I said: <i>“Sensei visited you when you weren’t doing that well either.”</i> Dave said: <i>“That’s right.”</i></p>
<p class='left'>Ralph would visit Dave’s overly equipped home gym once a week to <i>“pump rubber,”</i> as he called it. One of Dave’s exercise machines employed powerful rubber bands for resistance. Lindquist admitted to me that he mostly went to Dave’s gym to promote camaraderie within the Karate club members. Besides, his doing a couple hundred pushups and other grueling calisthenics during class a couple of times a  week probably obviated the requirement for any kind of weight training.</p>

<h2>James Kotzman</h2>

<p class='left'>Well, Jim Kotzman, although his mother once told me: <i>“His name is not Jim, we christened him James.”</i></p>
<p class='left'>Jim and I started training at the same time at Charles Miller’s York dojo. Jim was, as was everybody in his large family, an athlete. But, after about a year of karate and obtaining his green belt, Kotzman took off a few years. His football and wrestling coach, also a karate black belt, persuaded Jim to dedicate himself, as his brothers before him, to sports at York Catholic High. Jim played varsity football starting in the ninth grade. After high school Jim began training under Ralph Lindquist.</p>
<p class='left'>I competed in the black belt division for several years before I was awarded my black belt. I would borrow a black belt from Sensei Miller. After I had borrowed Charles Miller’s belt several times and he finally said: <i>“Keep it.”</i> Soon thereafter, I was awarded my black belt and Kotzman, still a brown belt, was competing in the black belt division. I loaned Jim Sensei Miller’s black belt and told him that I was going to say the same thing Miller had said to me and that he should <i>“keep it.”</i> That belt, worn and frayed, is hanging up today in Kotzman’s dojo and workout gym. Miller received that black belt from Lindquist and so karatedo moved forward from Lindquist, to Miller, to me and Jim.</p>
<p class='left'>Jim continued to improve himself in and out of the dojo. Jim finished college, became a high school history teacher, and was a highschool wrestling coach. He also was a heavily sought out personal trainer for some of the top collegiate wrestlers in southern Pennsylvania. </p>
<p class='left'>Here are some of Jim’s personal thoughts on Sensei:</p>

<img src="../images/ch 9 kotzman in gi.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Sensei Kotzman at his home gym practising a kick on Sensei Lindquist</div>

<p class='left'>Here are some of Jim’s personal thoughts on Sensei:</p>


<p class='left'>
  <i><i>“As for life lessons they are endless: How to openly  greet people, with a smile and a very firm handshake.  Where to position yourself in any social situation to be able to observe and vacate quickly if necessary!  How to read people and their possible motives.  Sensei drew you in, you always wanted more of him. So I spent many years making that trip up to Harrisburg.  I will always remember his eyes, they twinkled, when he spoke. ”</i></i></p>
<p class='left'><i><i>“Life lesson #200 Haha how to adjust to different social situations.  He could talk shit with a bunch of drunk young guys, and two minutes later hold a deep discussion with an Academician. He taught me how to be both physically and emotionally strong because without both you really have nothing.  He taught the lesson of hard knocks, meaning the more you wanted something you better be ready to pay the cost. I really could go on and on like I said his lessons never ended and went way past Karate techniques. ”</i></i> </p>

<p class='left'><i><i>“A few of Sensei's sayings I recall:”</i></i> </p>
<i><i>“"If you're not where you are, you're nowhere"”</i></i>
<i><i>“"Never break a promise, just be careful how many you make"”</i></i>

<p class='left'><i><i>“People at work used to ask if I ever had to use my training? I always very confidently responded <i>“every single minute of every day…”</i>  Sensei taught us how to be good honorable people willing to face any situation thrown our way!”</i></i></p>

<h2>Disrespect and Stupidity</h2>

<p class='left'>Bretz, Kotzman, and myself had an immense respect for O-Sensei Lindquist. But there was this guy… a multi-style black belt who would regularly visit the Harrisburg dojo. He was pretty good but perhaps a bit bombastic. He’d rarely spar Bretz, Kotzman, or myself because we’d whup up on him pretty hard as he’d attempt fancy kicks and moves. He was a bit too arrogant of his black belts from multiple styles. One night none of us of comparable age and rank were at class. So this butthead asked O-Sensei Lindquist to spar. That was the ultimate in disrespect. Lindquist was an advanced Sensei, a master, a karate pioneer that was three decades this guy’s senior. It was also stupid as Ralph was a veteran of military conflict where he killed people in hand to hand combat. Anyway, this goof started to bear down hard on Sensei. A.J. noticed the aggression and, recognizing Ralph’s demeanor, and, having witnessed similar scenarios before, removed all the students from the room saying <i>“You don’t need to see this.”</i></p>
<p class='left'>I’m not sure exactly what transpired but that multi-style black belt never showed his face again at our dojo.</p>


<h2>Trouble</h2>


<p class='left'>Trouble is my little brother: littler by nine years. I started bringing Robert along to my jaunts to the Harrisburg YMCA dojo when he was in third or fourth grade. He was hyperactive and, to say the least, he had problems concentrating at school. However, at karate class, for some reason, he did all the exercises and worked out diligently. Still, before and after class, he’d do appalling things and was, overall, generally rude. When we’d arrive at class Sensei would exclaim: <i>“Here comes Trouble.”</i> For over a decade, that’s what everyone called Robert: Trouble. </p>

<img src="../images/ch 9 robert sensei me.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Trouble, Sensei, and myself</div>

<p class='left'>One night Robert was paired up with Patty Lipsett. They were doing kicking exercises as they raised their knees to block. Trouble did a roundhouse, which Patty blocked with her knee. He yelled. What was that? He had kicked into one of Patty’s knee braces. She answered: <i>“steel</i>“. There was more to Patty that was steel than her knee braces and she helped temper Robert into a martial artist.</p>
<p class='left'>Going to a karate class where everyone, but Trouble, was an adult and was, actually, pretty hard-core.  Everyone trained seriously and expected Robert (ah, Trouble) to have the same attitude. Robert gravitated to sparing. Because he sparred adults, he never learned to pull punches and kicks. He didn’t have to, he was maybe seventy pounds and his opponents were blue collar hard working, muscular, hard fighting men.</p>
<p class='left'>Robert regularly attended tournaments with me. His kata was very good and he regularly won. But his kumite was amazing. His opponents were from schools where classes had been tailored for children. His competitors just weren’t ready for Trouble. </p>
<p class='left'>The problem with Robert training essentially full-contact was that he didn’t stay small forever. He trained regularly at Lindquist’s dojo until he was seventeen or eighteen. At that point he was (based on my one-eighty or so) still small at one-sixty but he was six foot and very strong. It got so the only karateka that would spar Robert were the fanatical black belt trainees like Bretz, Kotzman and myself. </p>
<p class='left'>Robert was, in many ways, trouble. He got expelled from high school at a time where his mother was President of the state school board. Understand that school officials had to go to the school board for approval to expel Robert. But Robert, in many ways, was far above any trouble he may have caused. After a year off school, he enrolled in a vocational technical high school and excelled. He ended up president of his class. He competed in cabinet making competitions and won state level competitions. In his forties Robert was laid off from his job on the plant floor so he went back to school and got an MBA. Today he’s the plant manager at the company he was laid off from but was reemployed at triple his original salary.</p>
<p class='left'>Robert recently spoke to me of one of his stronger memories of Ralph:</p>


<i><i>“At the end of class, right after meditation (which was tough for hyperactive kid) Sensei clapped his hands and said: ‘It’s not the doing but the sharing of the doing that brings the true essence of being.’”</i></i>


<p class='left'>That’s a powerful quote for a nine year old to remember throughout their life. </p>

<h2>Patty Lipsett</h2>

<p class='left'>When I visualize the hundreds of classes I attended at the Harrisburg YMCA dojo, there was always the same student in the back of class: Patty Lipsett. Patty is a tall lady and her brother, Jack, attended classes regularly as well. Both earned brown belts. Patty had bad knees. She wore braces on both knees. I recall that, almost in every other class, one of Patty’s knees would pop out. Dave Bretz and I would continue leading class but Ralph, who was typically in the back, would stop and help Patty get her knee back in place. I recently asked Patty how painful that was and how she had dealt with it for decades. She responded: </p>

<i><i>“When you love doing something, pain is a little thing. I remember Sensei and AJ playing tug of war, with me as the rope, just to put my knee back in.  One week the left knee,  next week, the right knee. One night AJ picked me up , threw me over his shoulder and carried me out. God he had a bony shoulder.”</i></i>

<p class='left'><i><i>“I remember Sensei stepping over me, completing the exercise. Once done, he asked how I  was.”</i></i></p>

<p class='left'><i>No pity, just a normal thing for me. Sometimes I walked out and sometimes I needed help.”</i></i></p>
<p class='left'><i><i>“One night AJ and Carol took me to their trailer. Fed me 6 shots of Yukon Jack. I felt no pain the rest of the night, and drove myself home.”</i></i></p>


<p class='left'><i><i>“Bad knees or not, Patty, at maybe five foot ten, was a stalwart fighter. She was tenacious. She had great punches and her kicks, despite bad knees, were dangerous. I inadvertently gave her a black eye one night as she was pushing me pretty hard. Ralph, who was extremely close to Patty, admonished me about that black eye saying he never wanted to see that again. Patty later explained to Sensei that she was pressing me and had walked into a punch.”</i></i></p>

<h2>Tim Messersmith and Don Pickel</h2>


<p class='left'>I often brought two other York guys to Lindquist class: Tim Messersmith and Don PIckel. Both obtained black belts from Ralph Lindquist. </p>

<p class='left'>Messersmith also started training under Charles Miller. When I was tested for brown belt, Messersmith and Vito Coviello were sitting outside drinking Coors watching the test through the window. This was in the seventies when Coors couldn’t go over the Colorado state line. But Messersmith had been competing in a conversion van competition in Colorado and, like Burt Reynolds in Smokey and the Bandit, brought a truckload back east. Tim was a small but very strong man. He’d regularly drive his custom van to Ralph’s class. Tim was a perfectionist that had been a competitive motorcyclist before Karate. He regularly won black belt kata in tournaments. In his sixties, TIm became an international level competitor in mountain biking.</p>


<p class='left'>Don Pickel was my training partner at a time, due to family and career, neither of us was able to get to class three to four times a week. He would come to my house at 6 AM and we’d train in my basement before work. At that point Ralph would come down to York for Saturday classes, so Pickel had the benefit of Lindquist training as well.</p>

<h2>Family</h2>

<img src="../images/ch 9 dad trouble jim, me Sensei.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">My Father, brother Robert, brother-in-law Jim, myself, and O-Sensei</div>

<p class='left'>Robert was family and Jim Kotzman became family. But those two weren’t the only members of the Denoncourt family that frequented Ralph Lindquist’s class. My older brother, Butch, was in the Navy and, when he was on leave, he’d come up to the Harrisburg class with us. He loved the intense workouts. Butch, oddly, recalls practicing blocks in the shower with Sensei. They had gotten into a discussion about blocking techniques and it turned into practice. My sisters Beth and Carol also came to class for a time. But it was my father who attended class long enough to obtain a green belt. My father had a PhD in Biology and Sensei Lindquist (who often called me D) respectfully called my father Doctor D. Of course that meant that everyone called my dad Doctor D. That name of respect became so regularly used that, at class, I called him Doctor Dad.</p>

<h2>Money Schools</h2>
<p class='left'>Many of our contemporaries from other dojos, once they achieved the level I, Bretz, and Kotzman did, opened up what I call money schools. Dojos where job one was to generate revenue. But our sensei did not embrace the money school philosophy. Consider that the Japanese word, dojo, means hall or place for immersive learning or meditation. And know that Okinawan karate, for centuries, was taught in hallways or outdoors. The concept of a money school didn’t make sense to us. We'd rather train at an institution lead by a master.</p>
