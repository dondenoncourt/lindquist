<p class="left">Heroes of a ‘lost’ war are considered heroes by their fellow GIs but not by the general public. Ralph Lindquist was a hero of a forgotten war. During the Korean war, Ralph was a member of the United States Army’s First Cavalry Division, 16th Reconnaissance Unit. During the war, he was awarded the Combat Infantryman's Badge, the United Nations Ribbon with five campaign stars, the Order of the Purple Heart, the Presidential Unit Citation as well as three medals from the Korean Government, presented by then South Korean President, Sygmund Rhee.</>


<p class="left">In January of 1950, secretary of state Dean Acheson made a grievous mistake when he publicly defined a defensive perimeter against the Communist menace in Asia. That perimeter was based upon an island defense line includingJapan, Okinawa, and the Philippines. However, Acheson neglected to mention Korea. North and South Korea are split at the 38th parallel separating the communist North from the democratic South. Kim Il Sung, the founder and leader of North Korea, wanted nothing more than to ‘liberate’ the people of South Korea and create a unified communist Korea. Acheson’s faux pas was the catalyst that sparked the Korean war[a].</>


<p class="left">A handful of autocrats inflamed that initial spark into the full fledged Korean War. First among these were the Communist overlords Kim Il Sung, Mao Zedong, and Joseph Stalin. Then there was the Democratic totalitarian Syngman Rhee, leader of Democratic South Korea. He was a monocrat that wanted to take over North Korea. There was yet one more autocrat in this dance who fanned the smouldering embers of conflict into an out of control wildfire, the United States hero of the World War Two Pacific Conflict, Douglas MacArthur. Many argued that MacArthur enjoyed functioning as the American appointed Chancellor of post-war Japan; kind of a modern version of the omnipotent Shogun of Japan’s past.</>


<p class="left">Mao Zedong liberated (his perspective) China in 1948 when he defeated Chiang Kai-Shek’s army and established the People’s Republic of China. Kim wanted to do for North Korea what Mao had done for China and unite all of Korea. Kim was sure the South Koreans were simply waiting to be invaded, upon which they would immediately join North Korea’s communist forces. When conferred for support, Stalin surmised that, since the US had not come to Chiang Kai-Shek’s aid, they were equally unlikely to come to Syngman Rhee’s aid.</>


<p class="left">Power hungry autocrats aside, this was a war played out by teenagers who lost the last remnants of their childhood in battles among the mountains of Korea, along with thousands killed and wounded or frostbitten toes and their very lives in battle. A war that called aging US WWII vets back to active duty, pulling them away from their families and thrusting them back into combat. A war watched closely by zealous Russian, Chinese, and Korean communists  but mostly ignored by uninterested Americans.</>


<p class="left">Kim Il Sung sought the approval and support required to attack South Korea from Joseph Stalin, the Premiere of the Soviet Union, and Mao Zedong, the chairman of the Communist party in China. Consent, firearms, and equipment obtained, on June 25th 1950, Kim Il Sung crossed the 38th parallel and launched a rather successful attack against South Korea.</>

<h2>The Communist Bloc</h2>


<p class="left">The United States was very concerned about the post WWII strength of the Communist Bloc, the communist satellite nations under the hegemony of the Soviet Union. With Germany, Italy, France, and other western european Democratic countries effectively disabled by WWII, the Communist Bloc was a concerning threat. The US put out a call to service for citizens to enlist to fight communism. But whereas kids had readily volunteered to fight Hitler’s Germany and the Japanese that bombed Pearl Harbor, they were reluctant to fight in a war against an unknown and misunderstood enemy. The draft was reinstated.</>


<p class="left">Ralph Lindquist was barely 21 when the Korean war began. He was a hard working son of a blue collar family from Scranton Pennsylvania that had somehow opened his own auto garage. But Scranton, which had at one time been a thriving community due to the coal mining and steel industries, was in an economic downturn.</>


<p class="left">Ralph Lindquist believed strongly in the United States. He wanted to make a difference. He enlisted in the Army. He became part of the 16th Reconnaissance for the 1st Cavalry. He was heavily trained in what is known today as Special Forces. His training included Jiu-Jitsu and Judo for the hand-to-hand combat that was often required for the typically solitary task of reconnaissance.</>

<h2>Warfare Against North Koreans</h2>


<p class="left">Ralph Lindquist did not arrive in Korea until October of 1950. Until that point things weren’t going so well for the United States’ defense of South Korea.</>


<p class="left">General MacArthur made many mistakes in the Korean war, but perhaps his greatest battle success (including even his WWII accomplishments) was the battle of Inchon with its daring but lucky marine landing. I say “daring but lucky” because both Stalin and Mao were sure that the USA would do a marine landing and there was one obvious place to do that. Furthermore, with the predictability of ocean tides, it was relatively easy to guess what would be the most appropriate time for a landing. Kim, who did not like or respect Mao, did not believe the US would brave a marine landing. However, land they did, with a fighting force of 75,000 troops and 261 naval vessels. The battle quickly led to the recapture of Seoul, the capital of South Korea.</>


<p class="left">MacArthur, invigorated by his huge success at Inchon, promptly decided to order his generals to take full control of the entirety of North Korea.</>

<h2>The March to the Yalu</h2>


<p class="left">This movement of UN forces from South Korea to North Korea came to be known as “The March to the Yalu”. The Yalu is the river that delineates the border between China and North Korea.</>


<p class="left">US politicians would have preferred MacArthur simply move a bit north of the 38th and block any attempts for the Inmin Gun to move back into South Korea. Instead MacArthur wanted to liberate North Korea.</>


<p class="left">MacArthur was absolutely sure China would not enter the war. And, even if they did, the intelligence he received told him China had as little as 20,000 troops, with a ceiling of 70,000.</>


<p class="left">But there were a couple of problems with the March to the Yalu. First, the winter of 1950 was the coldest in 100 years  and it came three weeks early. Second, the mountainous terrain of North Korea was endless, preventing mobility, communications, and the delivery of supplies. Third, the UN force spread themselves out too thin to protect from coordinated attacks. And finally, China had seven hundred thousand (not 20,000 or 70,000) highly trained troops ready.</>

<h2>China’s invasion</h2>


<p class="left">China bristled at United Nations troops at their border. Furthermore, Mao did not trust MacArthur. The Chinese took military control  away from Kim Il Sung and invaded North Korea on October 19th, 1950. That sheer size of the invasion took UN forces almost completely by surprise. Once the vastly underestimated Chinese Comunist Forces (CCF) troops crossed the Yalu, the battles that ensued were fierce and UN forces were put on retreat. Typically, battles ended merely because the Chinese supply channels were poor and they simply needed to acquire food and ammunition.</>


<p class="left">Matthew Ridgway was  put in command of the Eighth United States Army early in 1951. At that point the Eighth was an army that was in serious tactical retreat. Ridgway insisted on having command posts know where the Chinese were and estimates of their numbers. He’d visit a post and inspect maps that had red flags pinned where the commander understood Chinese to be. Ridgway would ask the commanding officer the last time reconnaissance had ascertained CCF location and numbers. At first they’d say a week or two ago. At that point Ridgway would take the flag off and say “If you haven’t verified within the past 24 hours, you don’t know”. After a while the posts had updated information -- or Ridgway would replace the commanding officer.</>


<p class="left">That’s what Ralph Lindquist was trained to do: reconnaissance. In the coldest winter in the last 100 years, it was the job of the 1st Calvary’s 16th Reconnaissance team to ascertain how many of the hundreds of thousands of CCF troops were lurking nearby.</>

<p class="left">Like most Korean war vets, Ralph rarely talked about his experiences. Vets don’t want to share their misery. But, every now and again, a piece would come out. In the late 70s we used to canoe down the Susquahanna river, camping on islands during the night. We’d ask Sensei to come and he’d decline. I remember saying the weather would be good but he said he knew how to deal with cold. He explained how he would ball up his socks every night in Korea and put them in his armpits to warm them up and dry them out. He did have all his toes even though I know now that many Korean war veterans lost several due to frostbite.</>


<p class="left">At a 1960s karate picnic, someone brought a brace of shotguns and a box of clay pigeons. When Ralph took a turn, he never missed. He was asked if he skeet shot regularly. He said he had never done it before. What he was familiar with was, he said. was known as the  “big gun” of the M1 Garand, It’s a bit surreal when you consider that Ralph acquired that clay pigeon mastery on live targets in Korea.</>


<p class="left">Later, at that same picnic, after some inquiries from Charles Miller, Ralph related a story. He said that his superior had spotted two Chinese officers in a nearby mountain. He gave Ralph the assignment of taking out those two officers. UN Forces had discovered that, while CCF troops were great fighters, they were often unable to adapt when their officers were gone. Miller asked if Ralph “got them”. Ralph said he succeeded in his mission. That’s all he said. Now, you just don’t go and take out two officers. You have to go through others to get to them.</>


<p class="left">Another alarming fact came from Ralph directly to me. He was irritated about a Black Belt magazine article on a highly publicized Karate instructor. The article said that this fellow had been training in Karate since the 1940s. He claimed he began his karate training when he lived in Germany and was part of the Hitler Youth program. Part of the program was to teach them self-defense. Understand that this somewhat famous Karate instructor’s first sensei was Ralph Lindquist, hence Ralph’s irritation. Ralph expounded: “I was strangling Chinese with piano wire in Korea in 1950 and I didn’t call that Karate”. Charles Miller confirmed the story saying he had spoken to Ralph about the use of such ghastly garrotes in Korea.</>


<p class="left">Ralph Lindquist had an odd quirk for a martial arts instructor, he abhorred wrestling. Many of us had wrestled in high school and college and enjoyed it when sparring matches ended up on the ground. We were reluctant to stop. But Ralph would sneer: “No wrestling”. And Ralph rarely sneered. So even when we benefited from wrestling matts at the YMCA we trained at, we never continued on the ground. After learning about Sensei’s Korean exploits and training, I think our “wrestling” reminded him too much of his grim and fatal experiences of ground fighting with garrotes and knives.</>


<p class="left">One story that was related to me during my research was that Ralph spent three weeks in a psychiatric ward in Korea. He had developed a severe stutter. I considered not mentioning this story but then I realized it illustrates that Ralph wasn’t some kind of fictional superman played on film by Chuck Norris or Arnold Schwarzenegger. Ralph Lindquist was but 21 to 22 years old. Stuff got to him. After his three week sojourn, he was sent right back to the front line.</>


<p class="left">General Ridgway was successful. He effectively turned an all out UN retreat into a stalemate. The UN, North Korea, and China began speaking of an Armistice in mid 1951. However, there were issues. Perhaps the biggest issue was the repatriation of prisoners of war. Some sixty percent of the extremely well treated Chinese and North Korean POWs held by UN forces did not want to go back to their native countries.</>


<p class="left">Despite armistice discussions, brutal fighting continued for 2 more years. Early in the conflict, Ralph Lindquist was captured by CCF.</>

<p class="left">Sensei Lindquist rarely spoke about his time as a prisoner of war. He sometimes recounted that the CCF piled them into train cattle cars and some of the GIs just gave up and later died. That short description, while giving the gravity of the situation, leaves out a lot of detail. The quick story is that, out of 7,000 US prisoners, 2,800 (40%) died in captivity. The following chapter provides more detail about the miserable conditions and deplorable treatment Ralph Lindquist endured and, thankfully, survived.</p>
