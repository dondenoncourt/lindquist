<h3>Spring 1963</h3>


<i>Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. Nam Myoho Renge Kyo.</i>

<p class='left'>It was 9 AM Sunday morning and four men were chanting as they sat in the samurai kneeling position. They were performing the Buddhist ceremony 0-Shodai-Me -- a ceremony led by a buddhist priest. This group’s priest was clothed in traditional gold and black buddhist robes. It was Ralph Lindquist. O-Sensei Lindquist was holding Nichiren Shu O-Juzu beads  (similar to Catholic Rosary beads) as he worked through its one hundred and eight stones. The attendees were Charles Miller, Jim Brown, and Art Hettinger. All three were Karate students training under Ralph Lindquist at Pennsylvania’s first Isshinryu Karate school.</p>
<p class='left'>How did Ralph Lindquist go from being a Prisoner of War who had lost his ability to speak to become a Nichiren Buddhist priest and Karate instructor?</p>
<p class='left'>When American POWs returned to their Army units, they were placed in rehabilitation centers. Ralph mentioned that the staff was very accommodating. He said that anytime of the day or night -- even 2 AM in the morning -- you could get a staff member to play checkers, ping pong, or just talk. Ralph slowly regained his ability to speak. Some of that speech loss was the result of extreme malnutrition. Much of the speech loss POWs experienced also came from depression.</p>
<p class='left'>Following weeks of convalescing at the repatriation facility, Ralph was given several months of Rest and Recreation (R&R) in Japan. Many of his GI compatriots imbibed in the traditional pastime of saki and women. But Ralph spent his time experiencing everything he could about Japanese religion and martial arts. He attended karate and judo dojos and visited various Buddhist and Shinto temples.</p>
<p class='left'>Upon return to the US, Ralph arranged for entry into Japan’s venerable six hundred year old Minobusan temple. He returned to Japan and attended the Minobusan temple for two years in 1954. He had a Korean roommate that had a similar past. His bunkmate had been a World War II Prisoner of War at a Japanese camp. He had been tortured by his captors and most of his teeth had been knocked out. Ralph’s Koren roommate was of great assistance in Ralph’s learning Japanese and keeping up with the Buddhist studies. In the 1960s Ralph’s Buddhist flatmate visited him several times at Ralph’s home in Camp Hill Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class='left'>Ralph continued his martial arts training even while being an acolyte of the temple. He would leave to attend classes at Gogen Yamaguchi’s Goju-ryu dojo. Yamaguchi was Goju-ryu’s grand master. Goju-ryu, by the way, was one of the styles of which Isshinryu was based. In the 1950s, Gogen’s dojo was Japanese only. But Lindquist was allowed to attend as he was a member of the Minobusan temple and spoke Japanese.</p>

<h2>Nam Myoho Renge Kyo</h2>

<p class='left'>Nam Myoho Renge Kyo was the phrase chanted in the O-Shodai-Me ceremony Ralph and his Buddhist/Karate students were chanting. Shodai is an abbreviated Japanese slang term that means, “chanting Daimoku” where daimoku means “sacred title.” Nam Myoho Renge Kyo means Devotion to the Mystic Law of the Lotus Sutra. For Nichiren Buddhism, that’s almost all you need to know. In my computer programming profession, we call statements like that recursive as it calls back to itself. Myoho means Mystic Law. In Buddhism mystic law is the Dharma, where dharma signifies cosmic law underlying right behavior and social order. Renge refers to the Lotus Sutra, which is the written doctrine of the teachings Siddhartha Gautama, the original “Buddha”, preached two and a half millennium ago. In chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, you are saying: “I believe in the teachings of the Lotus Sutra as a way to understand Myoho, the mystic law.” That said, you will be compelled to study and learn from the Lotus Sutra. </p>
<p class='left'>Siddhartha founded Buddhism two and a half millennia ago in India. His teachings were orally disseminated for four hundred years before they were written.The Hindi word for dialog is sutra. The Lotus Sutra contains Siddhartha’s dialogs. Buddhism moved from India, to Vietnam, Korea, and China. China, by the way, with its Taoism and Confucianism, readily adopted Buddhism. Buddhism moved to Japan around the 5th century. It was readily adopted in Japan as they, for the most part, had no formal religion.</p>
<p class='left'>Nichiren Daishonin was born in 1222. He was a Buddist priest before he was sixteen. He was a devout learner who studied all of the Buddhist Sutras and wrote about them in detail. Japan, at that time, had several scisms of Buddhism. Politics were tightly tied to one of those sects. Nichiren was much like Christianity’s Martin Luther in that he was very outspoken in his beliefs. His main belief was that the most important of the Buddhist Sutras was the Lotus Sutra. He was also compelled to spread his buddhist teachings to common Japanese. He ran into quite a bit of political retribution. There were a half-a-dozen governmentally sanctioned attempts on his life -- all of which failed. Some of the attempts were spine-chilling involving swords and such. In one scenario, however, he was simply left on a rock out in an ocean bay where the tide would certainly drown him. But a fisherman happened by and saved him. In another government sanctioned reprisal, he was exiled to an island. Nichiren simply used that time to meditate, further his understanding of the Lotus Sutra, and continue his writing. </p>
<p class='left'>Today Nichiren Buddhism is one of the most heavily followed Buddhist sects in the world. Nichiren Daishonin created the methodology of focusing Buddhism around the chanting of Nam Myoho Renge Kyo.</p>
<p class='left'>Buddhism is full of numbered lists. One of its mainstay lists is the Noble Eightfold Path. These are: right views. thinking, speech, action, way of life, endeavor, mindfulness, and meditation. The word “right” is typically repeated before each of the eight. By right, they more so mean proper. One thing I like about Buddhism is that it doesn’t tell you what right and proper are. That path varies per person. A big part of Buddhism is learning that your view, your perspective, and, hence, understanding is confused by preconceptions. Right view and thinking can only come from letting go of preconceptions and seeing or hearing clearly with fresh eyes and ears.</p>

<h2>At the Temple</h2>

<p class='left'>One of Ralph’s recollections was that everyone in the temple got up at “O Dark One Hundred” (just before dawn) and bathed naked in a frigid creek. Both men and women. Notwithstanding Indian, Chinese, and Japanese beliefs on a male dominant society, Siddhartha, twenty-five hundred years ago, claimed that anyone can become the Buddha, females included. After their cold bath, the acolytes had to pick up trash and weed the garden. Ralph said they almost never found anything but they still had to carefully look for weeds and trash. Often visitors would spot the naked cleaners but Ralph quipped: “It was cold so they didn’t see anything.” </p>
<p class='left'>It was Ralph’s job to clean the latrines -- a job that included syphoning out both liquid and solids out of a hole in the ground to a bucket for disposal. Ralph was told by one of the priests that he had the best job at the temple and he was lucky to have it. He was lucky because it taught humility. </p>
<p class='left'>Their training included chanting specific sections of the Lotus Sutra. Typically focused on chapters two and sixteen. Chapter two expounds that everyone is able to become a Buddha, and Chapter sixteen is a Sakyamuni Buddha's discourse on how life is eternal. Lead temple priests would lecture on the various sutras. </p>

<h2>PTSD and Buddhist view on suffering</h2>

<p class='left'>Both Ralph and his Korean roommate’s POW experience qualified them for Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD.) In my research of Buddhism, I found several psychiatric presentations that identified Buddhism as a “newly discovered” methodology for treating PTSD. Buddhism speaks quite a bit about suffering. Buddhism’s four Noble truths are all about suffering. </p>
<p class='left'>I’ll bet psychologists researching the management of PTSD through Buddhism would have liked to have interviewed Ralph and his roommate. I’ve read articles on the use of Buddhism to treat trauma where they spoke of car accidents as trauma. I agree. But Ralph's trauma was of killing Chinese soldiers, witnessing his GI comrades being killed, seeing his POW friends being beaten to death or dying of malnutrition or simply giving up. I never saw any hint of PTSD-like behavior in Ralph. His wife, Beverly, did say he would sometimes begin yelling in his sleep and lash out with his fists.</p>
<p class='left'>At Ralph’s funeral, one fellow -- who was probably close to 70 but looked like he could still do one-arm chin ups -- spoke briefly about how Sensei helped him. He was a chopper pilot in Vietnam that had experienced too much. He was almost in tears as he explained that Sensei's guidance helped him immensely.</p>

<h2>Sensei Ralph on Buddhism</h2>

<p class='left'>Ralph Lindquist was regularly asked to speak on Buddhism. On one of those occasions, he was asked to open a Karate tournament held in the Crispus Atticks community center in York, Pennsylvania. The tournament director’s name was Ken Newman. I remember that in particular because Newman was given my phone number to get in contact with Ralph Lindquist. I was 15 years old and Sensei Newman picked me up at my house on the drive to attend Ralph Lindquist’s class in Camp Hill. Newman was a pastor and a great man who helped numerous underprivileged kids in York PA through Karate training and ministry. We had a wonderful discussion on the ride up and back to class. </p>
<p class='left'>At the start of the tournament, Ralph came to the front of the gym dressed in traditional Buddhist garb. He spoke for a bit then opened the tournament. Imagine how proud I was: This being in the early 1970s when the TV Series Kung Fu was popular with its ass kicking buddhist priests. And there was my head instructor dressed like Master Kan.</p>
<p class='left'>A few years later, one of the men that regularly traveled with me to Ralph’s Harrisburg dojo was a Muslim. He invited Ralph to speak at a symposium where a Muslim mullah, a Jewish Rabbi, and Ralph, as a Buddhist priest, would all speak about their respective religions. The evening started with a mild disturbance as the women -- Jewish, Christian, Muslim, or otherwise -- were expected to sit in a area segregated for women. Ralph Lindquist’s wife, Beverly, a strong woman by any means, took deference to that imposition and made sure the organizers were aware of it. The Muslim mullan and Jewish Rabbi were fairly eloquent with their somewhat complex discussions. Ralph Lindquist, on the other hand, spoke very simply about his need to teach and the importance of leading. He said one thing that stuck with me. He said every teacher wants their students to be better than them. I remember because my training partner, Jim Kotzman, told me he thought Sensei was referring to me. I hope not because I certainly did not become a better martial artist, mentor, or humanitarian than Ralph Lindquist.</p>
<p class='left'>Sensei Charles Miller attended several of Ralph’s talks on Buddhism. One question often raised was: How is Buddhism different from Christianity? Ralph explained: Christianity believes in death bed absolution, which is similar to painting with oil and, at the end, you paint over the bad parts. Buddhism is like painting a picture with watercolor. You can’t paint over the bad parts as it will bleed through. </p>
<p class='left'>Vito Coviello recounted a story of a buddhist talk Ralph gave in the late 1960s. Ralph gave many lectures at various Pennsylvania universities. At a lecture at Elizabethtown College, Ralph dressed in the traditional buddhist garb. But, after the lecture he changed to his gi and came back to the stage with four of his advanced karate students: Vito Coviello, Jim Clark, Brenda Clark, and Joe Salzinger (I’ll cover these four in detail in a later chapter.) </p>
<p class='left'>None of these students had any idea what was about to transpire. Sensei had Brenda lay her body across Jim and Joe as they were prone on the floor on their hands and knees. Ralph had Vito place a watermelon on Brenda’s stomach. Ralph then sliced that watermelon eight times with a samurai sword. Brenda, by the way, was a teenager at the time. He then placed a smaller melon on Vito’s neck and sliced that melon a few times as well.</p>
<p class='left'>Not done, Sensei had Vito lay across the backs of Joe and Jim. Sensei then placed a concrete block on Vito’s stomach and smashed it with a 16 pound sledge hammer. I’m sure you’ve seen similar demonstrations but, in the late 1960s, this was stuff no one had seen before. At any rate, as one of the dismembered blocks crashed on Joe’s hand. Joe blurted out: “What the fuck was that?” Ralph told Joe softly: “Keep quiet you won’t die.” Still not done, Sensei had his students stand in the Isshinryu seisan front stance with arms in punching position. He then began breaking three quarter inch sticks of wood across their arms, shoulders, backs, and thighs. Joe again exclaimed: “What the fuck is this?” To which Sensei said: “Keep quiet and you will live.” After the demo, Vito took Joe to the hospital for finger repair and a hand cast.</p>
<p class='left'>So don’t think of Ralph Lindquist as the buddhist pacifist Dalai Lama or Master Kan of the Kung Fu TV series.</p>

<h2>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</h2>

<p class='left'>From time to time, before Karate class, I’d mention to Sensei the books I was reading in an effort to broaden myself. For a while I was reading about self-hypnotism and Ralph said he had no belief whatsoever in self-hypnotism. We also spoke about James Clavel’s Shogun. I think Ralph may have been impressed that a sixteen year-old read that 1,300 page tome in three days. I believe that may have contributed to why he agreed to write a letter of recommendation to York College for my early acceptance. </p>
<p class='left'>One evening I mentioned I was reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. It was the first religious or pseudo religious book I had read that Sensei liked. He said it was a good book both on engine maintenance and Buddhism. High praise for an expert mechanic and Buddhist priest.</p>

<p class='left'>Sometimes the Pirsig, the author, almost seems to be making fun of Buddhism. At one point he said:</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>Zen has something to say about boredom. Its main practice of ‘just sitting’ has got to be the world’s most boring activity… You don’t do anything much: not move, not think, not care. What could be more boring? Yet in the very center of this boredom is the very thing Zen Buddhism seeks to teach. What is it? What is it at the very center of boredom that you’re not seeing?</i></li>
</ul>

<p class='left'>But then Pirsig would say things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>The real cycle you’re working on is a cycle called yourself. The machine that appears to be “out there” and the person that appears to be “in here” are not two separate things.</i></li>
      <li><i>The [car] drivers seem to be thinking about where they want to be rather than where they are.</i></li>
</ul>

<p class='left'>I think what Sensei liked about Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was the author's approach. Pirsig spoke in detail about engine maintenance and more generally about philosophy. He was not trying to make a point about Buddhism. Whenever Ralph spoke in a philosophical nature, he never spouted Buddhist phrases using Hindi or Japanese terms -- rather he clearly and concisely expressed a belief or thought. </p>
<p class='left'>I also had a discussion with Sensei about the book: The Empty Mirror. It was a bestseller that was written by an American that attended Zen buddhist temple. Today it is considered to be a contemporary classic. Sensei’s response to The Empty Mirror: “I’m afraid it was an empty book.”</i> </p>

<p class='left'>Ralph rarely spoke about Buddhism but he finished each class with group meditation. I always felt a powerful presence coming off Sensei during this brief meditative period. I remember one night we had our last class in a room at the YMCA where we had trained for a half-dozen years. That room was being converted into a modern machine-based fitness center. Being what I thought was the last to leave, I noticed Ralph in a meditative position in the middle of the dojo. I felt a deep respect for this man that was saying goodbye to years of: <i>“Doing, and the sharing of the doing that is the essence and true value. The karate-do.”</i></p>
