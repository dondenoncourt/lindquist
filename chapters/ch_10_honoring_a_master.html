<p class='left'>In 1993, Ralph Lindquist was inducted into the Pennsylvania Karate Hall of Fame. The prestige of being inducted to the Hall of Fame was overshadowed by the tributes of attendees. The  attendees included not only dozens of Ralph Lindquist black belts, but Isshinryu figure heads of Harry Smith and George Iberl as well as Aikijujutsu master Patrick Byrnes. The photo above is but a portion of the attendees to the event as it was limited to O-Sensei Lindquist black belts. </p>

<p class='left'>One black belt made the journey to Ralph’s Hall of Fame induction from Florida: David Berndt. David started under Ralph Lindquist in the early 1960s when his parents wanted formal self-defense training for their teenage son (who was getting into too many fights.) There was one school to pick from. Like many of Sensei’s accomplished black belts David started out as a child and became a man under Ralph’s tutelage. David ended up being part owner in Harristown Jewelry with Ralph Lindquist. Ralph, to show his appreciation for David’s journey to the ceremony, gave David a painting of a man performing Sanchin. The painting had been made by the Isshinryu great Don Bohan and given to Ralph. </p>

<p class='left'>The ceremony was also attended by Lindquist students that did not obtain black belts. Ralph’s teaching helped many people that never reached black belt. Three such guests that night were Marie Fallon, David Merges, and Patty Lipsett. Merges was a car mechanic when he first began attending Ralph’s karate class. The drive to improve yourself that Ralph instilled in his students coerced David to go back to college and become a teacher at the local vocational technical high school. Marie Fallon was a soft spoken wisp of a girl. She was a seamstress pieceworker at a local factory. She began taking classes (like Dale Carnegie) and ended up a shift supervisor and then a manager. Marie competed at karate tournaments and, at one of them, as she was signing up as a brown belt, the head sensei of the school hosting the tournament pulled me aside and said: “She can’t enter the brown belt division.” At the last tournament this sensei had seen her compete, Marie had competed in the over-35 kumite in the men’s division and made this instructor’s male student’s look bad. He handed me a black belt and said: “She needs to compete as a black belt. Here’s a new belt, no charge, and she can keep it.” Competing that day, against women this time. Marie easily took home black belt division trophies. Well, that’s a Lindquist brown belt for you! Yes, that wasn’t an anomaly. Patty Lipsett also competed in the black belt division, as a brown belt. She placed and won at several tournaments.</p>

<h2>A.J. Boyd</h2>
<p class='left'>Also in attendance at Ralph’s induction to the Pennsylvania Karate Hall of Fame as A.J. Boyd. A few years after the ceremony, Ralph retired to Phoenix Arizona. A.J. Boyd became the lead instructor. A.J. himself was later inducted to the Hall of Fame.</p>

<p class='left'>Sadly, A.J. died one-month shy of retirement in 2006. His funeral was attended by several hundred people. A.J. was a regular attendee at that church and helping others was a way of life for him. Ralph Lindquist flew in from Phoenix to attend and present a eulogy. As always in formal occasions, Ralph was eloquent. He started out by saying: “This is not right.” as he pointed to the casket. A.J., like Ralph, was ex-military. Sensei told the story of Taps, which was played for the first time at a military funeral during the civil war and would be played for A.J. that day. This Buddhist priest certainly could have astonished attendees with proverbs about death but, as Sensei always did, he spoke using a manner that his audience would appreciate.</p>

<h2>Funeral Honors</h2>

<p class='left'>The final chapter of this book covers the continuation of Lindquist instruction but I want to provide a chronicle of Ralph’s 2015 funeral in this Honors chapter. </p>
<p class='left'>At the front of the chapel Ralph laid in the open casket clad in his gi. The room was packed with a hundred or so people. The right half of the sitting room was populated by black belts and Lindquist students from the sixties. The left side of the room was filled with black belts and students from the eighties, nineties, and the millennium with Sensei Charles Miller seated at the front. Sensei Jim Clark led the proceedings. Officer Clark, a retired policeman, asked anyone that had a story to stand up and recount their narrative. Many did. Everyone’s recitation was a testament to the impact Ralph Lindquist had on people’s lives. After a number of black belts from the sixties finished telling their stories and anecdotes, Charles Miller stood up, faced the group and said: “Karateka please stand and bow” and then turned to face the casket. Most of the attendees stood (but for a few of Ralph’s business friends) and we solemnly bowed to O-Sensei Ralph Lindquist.</p>


<p class='left'>After the bow, I stood up and began walking to the podium at the front. Jim Clark stopped me saying I could just do what everyone else had done and simply speak standing up in front of my seat. I continued walking to the podium and said: “I’d rather speak from here. I have a lot to say. I’m not the fastest Ralph Lindquist black belt nor am I the one with the best form or power. What I am best at, however, is kimi-wasa.” At that point Ralph’s significant other, a much bereaved Brenda Clark, whispered the meaning of kimi-wasa: “Mouth technique.” I acknowledged Brenda’s translation and explained that whenever there was too much talk in class Sensei would admonish us with: “Enough kimi-wasa.” I went on to tell stories of Ralph teaching from the mid-seventies to the nineties pointing out each black belt in attendance.</p>
<p class='left'>After I finally finished, other black belts stood up and added their stories. The most compelling was when Jim Kotzman said: “People ask me how often I use Ralph’s Karate training. I respond: ‘Every day.’” </p>

<p class='left'>The stories would have continued but a funeral representative interrupted and informed us that, not only were we running out of time, but the honor guard was waiting to perform their ceremony. As a war hero, Ralph was receiving full Military Funeral Honors. Representatives in formal uniform covered the casket with the United States of America flag, performed a brief ceremony, folded the flag and presented it to Brenda Clark. </p>

<p class='left'>Ralph Lindquist lived an honorable life. He honored the United States of America by enlisting in the Army, served in the Korean war, and was a prisoner of war. He honored Buddhism by following its tenets and leading others with skillful means. He honored his karate students by faithfulling teaching class for over sixty years. Ralph Lindquist is a man that deserves to be honored and remembered.</p>
