<p class='left'>When Ralph Lindquist was a young man he established three goals:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Own a Rolex watch</li>
  <li>Own a Brooks Brothers suit</li>
  <li>Own a Rolls Royce</li>
</ol>

<p class='left'>There was little chance that a man without any formal college education and from blue-collar Scranton PA (a city in severe industrial decline) would acquire any of those.</p>
<h2>What motivated Lindquist to make those goals?</h2>

<p class='left'>As to the Rolex: When Ralph was a teenager, one of the post World War II programs to improve the U.S included the expansion of  an airport in New Jersey. They were utilizing surplus scrap metal.The surplus included Bulova watches that had been made explicitly for soldiers. Construction workers were smashing this various war surplus with bulldozers. As a wandering teenager, Ralph spotted this wasteful use of unsaleable quality watches, ran up, and pilfered a few. One of those rescued Bulova watches was of high quality and Ralph kept it for the remainder of his life. The Bulova introduced him to quality timepieces that were manufactured with careful craftsmanship. The Rolex was the best timepiece available.</p>
<p class='left'>As to the Brooks Brothers suit: In the nineteen forties, quality clothing separated the classes. Back then folks didn’t go out without being well dressed. Still, people were able to easily discern the quality of suit one was wearing.</p>
<p class='left'>As to the Rolls Royce: When Rail was a youth he played in a local dump in New Jersey. A highway ran nearby and, quite regularly, Rolls Royces would drive by. Ralph vowed he’d have one of his own someday. But Ralph had another story that he claimed drove his love for the Rolls Royce. His parents both worked at a cigar factory. The owner had a Rolls Royce and he would let employees borrow it for special occasions. Anyway, Ralph claims he had an innate love of Rolls Royce’s because he believes he conceived in the backseat of one. Besides, Ralph was a mechanic. In fact, he procured his own auto service center before he was twenty. Again, like Rolex watches and Brooks Brothers suits, a Rolls Royce was the top quality automobile. Ralph appreciated handmade goods. Merchandise from Rolex, Brooks Brothers, and Rolls Royce were all handcrafted. In short, I think Ralph wanted to get there on time, looking good, and in style. Ralph foresaw himself going about his day well dressed, wearing a quality timepiece, and driving in an excellent car.</p>
<p class='left'>There may have been little chance of Ralph achieving those three goals but he overshot those objectives. He later owned, not just a Rolex, but a jewelry store; he owned not just one Rolls Royce but about a half a dozen; and he became president of a Rolls Royce club. That car Ralph joked he was conceived in? He tracked it down and bought it. On all pertinent occasions, Ralph was impeccably dressed. Even at the dojo, Ralph’s gi was always pristine white and clean. He would adjust the gis automatically. He used to say: <i>“Neatness is a politeness.”</i></p>

<h2>Blue Collar Struggle</h2>

<p class='left'>Before he was twenty Ralph had somehow procured, owned, and operated his own auto service center.  He had previously worked for a cigar manufacturer (one little known quirk about Sensei was that he would enjoy a fine cigar every week or so). The Korean war pulled Ralph away from his auto service business. But he kept his goal of financial independence. When he was at the Army base, he would make small change ironing clothes for his fellow recruits that wanted to look good when they went out on pass. Meanwhile, throughout the war, while most soldiers were blowing their meager pay, Ralph was setting much of his aside.</p>
<p class='left'>After the Korean war, when Ralph went back to civilian life, using his knowledge as a mechanic, he got a job as an auto insurance claims inspector for Erie insurance. Ralph was diligent at everything he did and claims was no different. One interesting story came about while he was investigating insurance fraud. He traced leads to a body and fender shop. Ralph could hear people inside but the doors were locked and no one responded to his knocks. So Ralph climbed up to a second floor window and peered inside to see a man spray painting a car. The fellow spotted Ralph and came over and spray painted the window so he could no longer see. Ralph went to a second window, and a third, and the man continued to spray shut the view. But, at that point, Ralph had all the information he needed. Most claims investigators would have been reticent to put themselves in harms way with criminals but this war hero martial arts expert wasn’t overly concerned.</p>
<p class='left'>Ralph continued to work his way up the ladder at Erie insurance. The insurance company’s co-founder O.H. Hirt created the company with the mantra: <i>“ERIE is Above all in sERvIcE.”</i> The E R I E in the company name came from the uppercase vowels in the word service. Early in Ralph’s career at Erie, Hirt was coming into town so management assigned a lesser employee to drive him around. That <i>“lesser”</i> man was Ralph Lindquist. The two hit it off immediately. Ralph became good friends with this billionaire creator of a Fortune 500 company. Whenever Hirt was in Harrisburg he would insist Ralph be available to drive and otherwise pal around with him. Ralph would regularly have Hirt over to his home for dinner parties. The following lists (Source: About Hirt https://www.erieinsurance.com/blog/wit-and-wisdom) Hirt’s philosophy and they mesh well with Ralph’s, and I’m sure that’s why they became friends:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Know your stuff. Believe your stuff. Do your stuff.</li>
  <li> That one word <i>“Harmony”</i> says everything.</li>
  <li> Knowledge is power – and we want everyone in our organization to have all the power that education can give them.</li>
  <li> Never lose human touch.</li>
  <li> Insist upon thinking.</li>
  <li> Hold fast to that which is good.</li>
  <li> The secret of successful salesmanship is giving enough people the opportunity to say yes to the right proposition.</li>
  <li> Success in business is not a matter of tricks or gimmicks, or even of education and training. It is just a matter of simple common sense, mixed with just plain decency.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Flea Markets and Yard Sales</h2>
<p class='left'>I remember one Saturday, in the late eighties, when Ralph had driven down to visit my York dojo. I met him at his car and we began walking to the dojo. Our progress was impeded by a one-day street-side flea market. I waited, very impatiently, as Ralph carefully looked over everything on a series of tables. In my opinion, it was all junk. But my <i>“opinion”</i> was of little value and meant next to nothing. Had there been anything that wasn’t junk, Ralph would have spotted it. Ralph had been frequenting flea markets, yard and estate sales for decades. He went to auctions so regularly that he was often asked to be the caller. Vito Coviello told me that Ralph took him to many auctions where Ralph mentored him on the acquisition of quality oriental knotted rugs. Today Vito has a large collection of extremely valuable rugs.</p>
<p class='left'>Most everyone has had, at one point or another, a yard sale. You’d have it on a Saturday and you would put notice in a local paper saying that it started at nine AM. But someone always seemed to be ringing your doorbell at seven AM. If you lived in the Harrisburg area, that person, very likely, was Ralph Lindquist. He’d be dressed in his favorite bib overalls and he’d be driving a Volkswagen Rabbit. If you had something that interested him, he’d bargain on price (using the colloquial language of the son of a blue collar PA steel town) and you had no idea the item was of extreme value or that the buyer could have driven a Rolls Royce rather than a VW Rabbit.</p>
<p class='left'>Many of the items Ralph had acquired from these yard sales, flea markets, auctions, and estate sales he later sold at Harristown Jewelers.  Harristown Jewelers was the store he opened in the early seventies with Dave Berndt, one of his black belts. Before the jewelry store, Ralph was selling valuables acquired at yard sales and flea markets at actions and through newspaper classifieds. He would often buy paintings, not for their artwork, but for its quality frame. He used to say: <i>“Time, place, and circumstance.”</i></p>

<h2>Rolex</h2>
<p class='left'>Ralph had a small collection of antique Rolexes, which he always wore. He once said: <i>“The purposefulness of something is in its use.”</i>  Vito was impressed with Ralph’s love of Rolexes and purchased a stainless steel <i>“DateJust”</i> for $250. It had an oculus showing the new date each day. Just after Ralph acquired Harristown Jewelers, he called Vito and asked him if he was interested in a new Rolex ordered by someone who later decided to not complete the purchase.  Ralph offered Vito the opportunity to purchase the new GMT, gold and stainless steel, Rolex for $800 plus his old Rolex. Vito agreed and he has worn that watch for 42 years. Recently he had the watch serviced.  The jeweler was enamored with the antique and offered Vito $3,000 to purchase it. Vito continues to wear that watch every day.</p>


<h2>Property and Investments</h2>

<p class='left'>Ralph used to say: <i>“Never fall in love with a piece of real estate.”</i> I’m not sure how much property Ralph owned but I know he and Vito Coviello created a formal partnership and bought multiple properties together. I also know some of my fellow karateka worked on some of Ralph’s rental properties. Vito told me:</p>
<p class='left'>After moving to California it was decided to sell our properties. While living in California for almost 40 years I began to buy various types of property such as condos, houses and ranch property.  Fortunately for me, Ralph’s business acumen helped me solidify my security for the rest of my life.”</i></p>
<p class='left'>Ralph Lindquist also dabbled in the markets. Again, from Vito:</p>

<p class='left'>
  <i>Sensei was an investor and businessman.  He was also a private man.  It took some time to crack his protective shell, and when it happened, we were able to communicate.  I loved the concept of investing and one of its paths, the stock market.  For several years I ate my lunch at a local Harrisburg Brokerage firm  looking at the Tape and reading/learning.  Ralph helped me understand the system which helped me make money.</i>
</p>


<p class='left'>Sensei Miller lived in York but worked in Harrisburg. He would sometimes drop in unexpectedly at Ralph’s home in Mechanicsburg. One Tuesday night he popped in and was turned away by Ralph’s wife Beverly.  Beverly initially simply said: <i>“It’s Tuesday.”</i> But, seeing Charley’s confused look, Beverly explained that every Tuesday night, Lindquist dedicated the evening to working on his finances. Tuesdays make sense to me now as Karate class had been held on Monday and Thursday nights for decades. Besides dabbling in the stock market, Ralph would move his banking — often weekly — even when the point change was as little as half-a-percent.</p>
<p class='left'>At times Ralph would tell us kids (like Jim Kotzman and I, when we were in our early twenties) to put money into a 401K. <i>“Even if it’s a dollar a week,”</i> he’d say. I didn’t and, unlike Vito, I haven’t <i>“solidified my security for the rest of my life.”</i></p>
<p class='left'>One curious and somewhat funny thing about Ralph was that he always played the lottery. I’ve heard some very smart people say that playing the lottery is an intelligence test. Ralph didn’t pass their test but he only ever bought one ticket. I heard him say many times: <i>“Until I win the lottery….”</i> It was funny to hear about this man — with a jewelry store, properties, a well paid job, and several Rolls Royces — playing the lottery.</p>
<p class='left'>I used to drive some veritable klunkers from York PA to class in Harrisburg. But I had no payments on them. Ralph used to say: <i>“If you aren’t making car payments, you are making money driving that car.”</i> In fact, while I never heard Ralph brag about his Rolls Royce’s, I did hear him brag about another car. One day I met him at a Saturday class at Dave Bretz’s house. Ralph drove up in a Volkswagen Rabbit. He got out, patted the car hood and said: <i>“Nice car. Good car. Company car.”</i> His job at Erie Insurance didn’t really warrant him having a company car but he figured out a way to get one. He certainly was <i>“making money”</i> driving that VW rather than making payments on a standard upper middle class automobile.</p>

<h2>Rolls Royce</h2>


<p class='left'>Ralph’s VW wasn’t his only car. As this book’s cover shows, he owned a Rolls Royce. It had been one of his life’s goals to own a Rolls Royce. From making small change ironing fellow GI clothes, to gaining half-percentage points on savings, playing the stock market, buying and selling property, and making top dollar at Erie insurance, by the late nineteen sixties, Ralph had more than enough money to buy a Rolls Royce. But, like everything else he did, Ralph wanted to do it right and get the best Rolls Royce he could. He found a 1956 Silver Wraith WSG6 that was for sale in England.</p>
<p class='left'>But there was a problem with buying that Silver Wraith: The owner refused to sell unless he met and approved the buyer. The owner was Lord Clark. That’s right: he was British Royalty with a title. He was also known as Major Clark as he had an outstanding career in the British military. After Ralph Lindquist and Lord Clark communicated several times, it was agreed that Ralph and Beverly would visit Lord Clark by staying at the manor house on his estate for a week or so. During that visit, Ralph and Beverly went on the Wholly Ghost tour from England through Ireland and Scotland.</p>
<p class='left'>Lord Clark liked Ralph and Beverly so much that he not only agreed to the sale but he personally managed the containerization and paid for its shipping to the United States.</p>
<p class='left'>Understand that, until the sixties, all Silver Wraiths were custom made to order. The Rolls that British royalty would order would have been something special. And this one was. Most Rolls Royce were designed with the concept of a paid driver. The back seat is where much of the finery was added. This one had dove gray leather seats, matching gray shearling foot mats, airline type tray tables in the back seats. In the back seat, you’d push a button over your left shoulder and a double door would open in the middle of the back seat for a decanter of liquid refreshment.</p>

<div class="caption">Back seat of the Silver Wraith</div>

<p class='left'>Ralph Lindquist asked Charley Miller to drive down with him to the Dundalk Marine Terminal in Maryland. It arrived in a sealed shipping container. Ralph drove the Wraith back to York (and then Harrisburg) while Charles drove Ralph’s commuter car.</p>
<p class='left'>Lindquist jumped into the world of Rolls Royce with the same fervor as martial arts. He joined several Rolls Royce clubs and began to compete in events. His Silver Wraith won top honors in his first competition. Ralph enjoyed the folk from the Rolls Royce clubs. He often took Charles Miller or Vito Coviello to events. He would mention to them before the event to observe specific people. Many of the members of the various Rolls Royce clubs of which Ralph was affiliated were of old, old money. One couple was Ken and Mermie Karger. They were editors of the magazine The Flying Lady (named after the Rolls-Royce hood ornament.) They had money that was several generations old. Yet Ken's normal attire was a green military surplus coat that had rip and tear corrections made with duct tape. But they were also very down to earth and educated. Ralph had them at his home for dinner parties. Memie Karger, in one of her editorial pieces said: <i>“Although I have a passable knowledge of the workings of my Ghost, it was fascinating to learn more of the whys and wherefores (as Ralph Lindquist used to say) of those earlier and later than mine.”</i></p>

<img src="../images/ch 8 p3 hardtop Rolls.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Sensei's Phantom III Hardtop 12 Cyclinder </div>


<p class='left'>A few years after acquiring the Silver Wraith, Ralph procured a 1937 Rolls-Royce Phantom III 3DL198 hard top. It had 12 cylinders and 24 spark plugs. One story Raph told about the P3: He and Beverly were driving it on a Wholly Ghost tour in the Great Smoky Mountains. They were in the right lane driving uphill. A couple of young guys in a sports type car drew alongside. Ralph put his foot on the gas and pulled ahead a little. The sports car did the same. Ralph accelerated again and they matched them. Then, for the final time… Ralph turned, smiled at them, waived and put more pressure on the gas pedal. The Rolls sped out of sight as they continued climbing the mountain. That sports car couldn’t keep up with 12 cylinders!</p>
<p class='left'>The P3 was also a touring car; it had an eighty Imperial gallon gas tank. Ralph used to enjoy pulling it up at a filling station and asking the attendant to fill it up. One poor fellow got on his hands and knees as he was looking for a leak as the pump kept going! George Dillman told me he went on a long road trip with Ralph in the P3 and was a bit nervous about the fact that it did not have a gas gauge. Lindquist did talk Dillman into buying a Rolls-Royce. Dillman had it for years then sold it, at a profit, to a man that wanted to drive it in a parade in California.</p>
<p class='left'>Ralph later replaced the P3 with a 1925 Silver Ghost S137ML Phantom II drop top (shown in the photo above alongside the Silver Wraith). Ralph went on many road trips with the Silver Ghost including one that went through Washington State, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana.</p>
<p class='left'>Ralph continued to exhibit his Rolls-Royces at competitions. He always did his own work. Friends and family knew to save old toothbrushes so Ralph could use them to clean the engines and undersides of his Rolls-Royces before competitions. Ralph bought and sold a half-dozen or so Rolls Royces and Bentlies. I remember him driving to Jim Kotzman’s wedding reception in a Rolls Royce Silver Shadow.</p>
<p class='left'>I want to close this section with a story about what kind of man this was that had multiple Rolls-Royces and crazy wealthy friends: There was a neighborhood teenager that jokingly mentioned to Ralph about using his Rolls-Royce for his prom. Ralph shocked him by agreeing he’d drive him. As always, Ralph did it in style. He did the complete chauffeur thing — which included wearing a black suit and chauffeur’s hat. He opened and closed the doors for the teenage couple and waited, dutifully, in the parking lot, while the teenagers enjoyed their prom.</p>


<h2>Road to Wealth</h2>
<p class='left'>This book is about a martial arts pioneer, more so than the monetary wealth spoken of in this chapter. Many of Ralph Lindquist's martial arts peer group became wealthy from teaching and promoting karate, such as the industry luminaries of: Danny Pai, George Dillman, George Iberl, Ed Parker, and Jhoon Rhee. Yet Ralph never looked for limelight or wealth for teaching karate. One Christmas season, the regularly attending black belts (Bretz, Kotzman, Wolfe, Messersmith and myself) were discussing what to give Ralph as an honorary Holiday gift. I suggested a million dollars! I explained that Ralph was a capitalist yet he made nothing from teaching us (at the time we were at the Harrisburg YMCA and there were no instructional fees.) I suggested, to show our appreciation, we’d get a plaque made that held a metal check for a million dollars and the endorsers would be all of us black belts. We procured an engraver who created a metal check with copies of our signatures. When I presented the plaque to Sensei Lindquist I stated: <i>“We hope you don’t cash this but rather let it continue to appreciate. Our appreciation for you is already worth more than a million dollars.”</i></p>
