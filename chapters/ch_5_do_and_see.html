<p class="left">A few months after Harry Smith finished his tour in Okinawa, he ran into Richard Keith at the Harrisburg Marine recruit station. They decided to reinvigorate their Isshinryu skills by opening a dojo. They placed a newspaper ad asking for men to bring fifty dollars to the YMCA to pay for their first month’s instruction. Curiously, after their first class, the YMCA told them they would need to find other facilities. I can only imagine what shenanigans went on to cause the YMCA to ask Smith and Keith not to return. Especially when I consider that these were two hardcore marines had undergone some of the most rigourous martial arts training in the world.</>


<p class="left">The first student to enter their class was Ralph Lindquist. Training by hardcore marines was not an issue to this special forces Korean war hero. Initially the class swelled to one hundred but Smith and Keith quickly pared it down to a couple dozen hearty souls. Most were men, many of which were career military or law enforcement.</>


<p class="left">The school moved to the basement of Harry’s house that Lindquist and Smith fixed up. Right from the start, Ralph handled the monies and otherwise managed the school. Ralph managed the tournaments, including Pennsylvania’s first Karate tournament in Pittsburg in 1964.</>

<h2>Class Temperament</h2>


<p class="left">Every dojo has a particular temperament: an attitude and a feel. Harry Smith’s class was two to three hours long. Most Karate classes today are an hour -- even at that they often stop short at 50 minutes. For Harry’s class, visualize marine basic training combined with practicing punches and kicks to one another. Harry Smith was a big believer in sparring whereas RIchard Keith was a strong advocate of kata.</>


<p class="left">George Dillman (one of Harry’s original students) told me, everyone was afraid of sparing Harry -- with the notable exception of Ralph Lindquist. Dillman said the Ralph/Harry sparring sessions were battles. Another original Smith student was George Iberl. Iberl was a big man yet he received several sets of broken ribs from Smith. Now image five foot two inch Ralph sparring regularly with the six foot sadist Smith. Dillman told me that everyone was also afraid of sparring Ralph.</>


<p class="left">Quick side story: In the late 70s, after a class, I came bounding down the locker room stairs. A very athletic looking man looked at me, leaped into a stance and said: “Oh. Black Belt. Let’s fight.” I waved him off. My black belt training partner, Dave Bretz, followed me and the man gave him the same challenge. Then the fifty-some Ralph Lindquist followed. The man did his leap to a stance and again and repeated his challenge: “Ah, Black Belt. Let’s fight.” Ralph got in a fighting stance. After a few moments Ralph opened his hands and said: “I’m ready.” The man waved his hands and said: “Oh, I’m just kidding.” I’m not sure if that man realized how much hurt and pain he was extremely close to experiencing.</>


<p class="left">At one point another karate school visited the Smith dojo. George Dillman had to spar a large muscular man. The guy wiped the floor with George. He was kicking him all over the dojo with big heavy kicks. After class, Smith grabbed Dillman and said: “My students do not back up!” He told George that the school was coming back in a few weeks and he’d be sparring the same man again. Furthermore, if Dillman did not best the man, Dillman would have to spar him. As I said, everyone was afraid of sparing Smith. Dillman had his friend and personal instructor, Ralph Lindquist, show him how to crowd kicks. The big fellow returned and Dillman destroyed him. Dillman went on to be a national fighting champion and an internationally known martial artist.</>


<p class="left">Ralph had a silly quirk in his otherwise seriousness about Karate training. When he would spot Harry out of the context of class, and, when Harry was unaware of Ralph’s presence, Ralph would attack him with punches and kicks. Ralph told me that he’d be crossing the street in downtown Harrisburg dressed in a suit, see Harry, attack him and a brief battle would ensue. Then they’d straighten out their clothes and, without a word, go about their way. Harry said Ralph was a precursor to Inspector Jacques Clouseau’s Cato Fong of Peter Sellers’ Pink Panther movies. It was Cato’s job to attack Inspector Clouseau at unexpected times. The first film in that series came out in 1963, a few years after Ralph’s random attacks on Harry.</>


<p class="left">After one class, Harry, Ralph, George, and a few others went to a bar owned by Shoes, one of Harry’s students. Ralph did not drink but the others were enjoying a few draft beers. Anyway, Shoes asked Ralph and Harry to prevent a fight between two guys that were in a heated argument at another section of the bar. Harry and Ralph approached the two. Ralph, undoubtedly, was prepared to reason with the antagonists. But Harry employed a somewhat more brusque approach and simply knocked both of them out.</>


<p class="left">At one Saturday class, Harry took his students on a field trip to a local  farm. There Harry confronted a bull and knocked it out with a punch. There are several well known stories of famous karateka killing bulls and I guess Harry wanted to give it a try. This bull, however, sprang right back up after stumbling from the punch.</>


<p class="left">Ralph told me a story about a tournament held in a high school gymnasium. The tournament’s Grand Champion wanted to test himself against the great Harry Smith. He pushed and pushed so finally they relented and agreed to have a sparring session at a somewhat closed off area on the school’s stage. Ralph told me Harry was scared about the match. In Harry Smith’s book, Striped Moons, Harry said he was always petrified before any competition or military exercise. Fear stimulates the adrenal glands and Harry admits to being addicted to adrenaline. Why that guy had to fight Harry, I don’t know. They squared off and bowed to each other. But, just as his opponent was raising from the bow, Harry kicked him, leaped on top of him, and began pummeling him and had to be pulled off the grand champion.         .</>


<p class="left">There were no paper tigers in Harry Smith’s class. Many of today’s self proclaimed Karate experts couldn’t punch their way out of a paper bag. Harry’s students were all notable. Many went on to serve in the military or police force. A dozen or so opened up their own schools and gained international notoriety.</>

<h2>George Dillman</h2>

<img src="../images/ch 5 george george ralph.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">George Iberl, George Dillman, and Ralph Lindquist</div>


<p class="left">When Dillman started training under Harry, Lindquist took him under his wing. Ralph was a Green belt at that point. Lindquist told Dillman that he had a higher rank from other dojos he attended in Japan but he dropped back to white belt when he started under Harry. When Ralph was attending the Buddhist temple in Japan, he was also frequenting Gogen Yamaguchi’s dojo. Gogen was the grand master of Gojo-ryu (one of the styles Isshinryu was based on.)</>


<p class="left">When Dillman reached green belt, Ralph was a brown belt. When Ralph made black belt, Dillman was a brown belt. Ralph used to pick Dillman up at his home for Saturday morning classes. Sometimes George would be hung over and would complain: “I’m sick, I can’t go to class  today.” Ralph would respond: “You can be sick at class.” And he’d drag him off to the dojo.</>


<p class="left">When Dillman was a brown belt he opened his own school at the New Cumberland Army depot. Ralph would often visit and help teach. At one point, Dillman took a dozen or so of his students to one of the famous Robert Trias tournaments. Trias confronted Dillman, admonishing him for having his own school yet competing as a brown belt. He told Dillman that he should compete as a black belt. Furthermore, if Dillman did well, Trias would formally award him a black belt. Dillman performed exemplary and Trias promoted him.</>


<p class="left">When Ralph found out about Dillman’s advancement he told him: “I’ve tested you for all your previous rank. You aren’t a black belt until I test you.” He arranged for Dillman to come to his school in Camp Hill. When Dillman showed up, Ralph went to the front door and locked it. Dillman asked him: “Is that so no one will come in?” Ralph said: “No. That’s so you don’t leave.” Now, this sounds a bit like the lyrics from Kenny Roger’s Coward of the County: “But you could've heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and locked the door.” But that song did not come out until 1979 and this was in the sixties, and Ralph was a bit tougher than Tommy.</>


<p class="left">Ralph had Dillman perform a number of the Isshinryu kata and then they began to spar. They spared “rough” for two hours.  When they finally stopped, their gis were sopping wet. Ralph congratulated him saying: “Now you are a black belt.”</>


<p class="left">Dillman became one of the winningest black belts in the country. He became close friends with Bruce Lee and Mohammed Ali and is covered in biographies of both men. His annual East Coast championship was one of the biggest  tournaments in the country. On my twenty-first birthday, I competed in one of Dillman’s tournaments. Ralph Lindquist attended. At that point I had no idea the great George Dillman was a Ralph Lindquist underbelt so I was amazed when Dillman spent every spare moment speaking with Ralph. Dillman told me recently: “I loved Ralph like a brother.”</>

<h2>George Iberl</h2>


<p class="left">Another internationally known Isshinryu sensei is George Iberl. George met Ralph Lindquist by chance at a retail store and their shared interest in martial arts came up in conversation. Ralph invited Iberl to visit his home for introductory instructions on Isshinryu. Iberl trained at Ralph’s backyard dojo many times. George wanted to attend Harry Smith’s school but, having recently emigrated from Germany, he wanted to improve his English before attending group classes. One feature of the Lindquist home dojo was makiwara striking post training. Iberl continued extensive makiwara training for decades. In the seventies, a friend of mine dated Iberl’s niece. When he went to pick her up at Iberl’s house, he heard the whack, whack, whack of Iberl’s makawari strikes. Then George came out to introduce himself, with his deep German accent,  as the uncle of the teenage girl my friend was about to take on a date.</>


<p class="left">Iberl trained under Smith and Lindquist until he was a brown belt. He credits Lindquist with teaching him most of the Isshinryu kata. Iberl moved to DC for a time and when Angi Uezu (Tatsuo’s son-in-law) visited the US, Iberl convinced him to stay at his home for several months. It was from Angi that Iberl received his black belt. Iberl continued to study under Angi for many years and achieved high rank. He opened karate schools in Gettysburg and York Pennsylvania. He ran dozens and dozens of tournaments over the course of many decades. I competed in many of them myself. Iberl attended Ralph’s funeral in 2015 and passed away himself in 2020.</>


<h2>Fierce Competitor</h2>

<img src="../images/ch 5 ralph 1st bb fighting dillman tourney.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Lindquist (far right) first place in black belt fighting at a George Dillman tournament</div>


<p class="left">Ralph Lindquist was a regular competitor in Karate tournaments. Dillman often travelled and competed with Lindquist. In the early 1960s, when tournaments were rather irregular, karateka traveled from all over the country to compete. Often competitors had dozens of elimination bouts before making it to the finals. Despite Ralph’s short stature, he most always made it to the finals and often won his division. I was lucky to find a YouTube video of one of those early tournaments and it contained a short clip with Ralph fighting. He fought exactly as I was told he fought -- always attacking on 45 degree angles as he constantly circled his opponent. He never backed up. In that one match he did, at one point, throw a lunging  punch where he whacked his opponent and ended up behind him.</>


<p class="left">Ralph competed at Canada’s first karate tournament in 1963. It was hosted by Masami Tsuruoka (who is recognized as the father of Canadian karate.) Ralph competed in the Black Belt division despite still being a brown belt. The day after the tournament, Harry had Ralph test for his black belt in front of Tsuruoka. He was promoted on the spot. Tsuruoka and Lindquist became good friends. Ralph continued to attend Masami yearly Canadian tournaments and Tsuruoka would travel to Harrisbug for several of the tournaments Lindquist arranged and promoted.</>


<p class="left">One competition story Ralph told me was that he was fighting a huge man. You’d think the crowd would support the little guy but, seeing Ralph’s prior bouts, they were shouting “Kill him, Kill him” to their six foot two inch underdog friend. I’m not sure the jeers helped as Ralph remembers splitting the guys cup in half with a front kick.</>


[photo of Ralph after winning his division at a Dillman tournament]


<p class="left">Charles Miller told me of Ralph’s sparring skills: “He was a ghost, he was never where he should have been when you fought him.”</>


<p class="left">One Ralph technique that I remember in particular was a reverse punch / back kick. He’d power in with his devastating reverse punch and, on the retraction, he’d do what he called “a hip switch” and nail you with a pile driver back kick. If you were lucky enough to block the reverse punch you were never ready for the back kick that came a quarter second later -- and at an unstoppable angle.</>


<p class="left">Ralph competed all over the east coast and Canada. He also regularly competed in the Robert Trias tournaments in Chicago. He had numerous trophies which he eventually donated or disposed of.</>

<img src="../images/ch 5 ralph potatoe 1.jpg" class="center"</>
<div class="caption">Sensei Lindquist, with a samurai sword, slicing a potatoe on the stomach of a teenage female student</div>


<h2>The Pittsburgh School</h2>


<p class="left">In 1962 Harry Smith moved to Pittsburgh and opened a new school. At that point Ralph Lindquist formally took full control of the Harrisburg school. Nevertheless, Ralph regularly drove to Pittsburgh to continue training with Harry Smith. He also provided personal training to many of the Pittsburgh students. Harry Aklin, for example, started under Harry in Pittsburgh and went on to have a string of successful dojos in Ohio. Besides regularly visiting the Pittsburg dojo, Ralph would often meet Aklin at a rest stop halfway between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh to train Aklin in kata.</>


<p class="left">In 1966 Shimabuku Tatsuo visited the Pittsburgh dojo for several months. Ralph attended many of the training sessions. The club filmed Tatsuo performing all the Isshinryu kata. Ralph had copies of those 8mm files. At times he’d review the film for a last word on movement in Kata. Those 1966 videos are now famous and readily available on Youtube.</>


<p class="left">Note that Dick Keith, who started the Harrisburg Isshinryu dojo with Harry Smith, after another session of training on Okinawa with Tatsuo in the early 1960s, stopped formal training and dedicated his life to the military.</>

<h2>Notable Students</h2>

<p class="left">The greatness of Ralph Lindquist was more than his fighting and kata skills: it was his mentoring. Ralph trained numerous notable students. Perhaps my favorite Lindquist saying was: “Do and see; see and do.” Ralph felt strongly about teaching and the concept of: “To teach is to learn twice.” In this chapter I’m going to cover a few of the students Ralph trained in the 1960s:</>


<ul>
  <li>Jim Brown</li>
  <li>Jim Clark</li>
  <li>Brenda Clark</li>
  <li>George Dillman</li>
  <li>Art Hettinger</li>
  <li>George Iberl</li>
  <li>Ron Lawrence</li>
  <li>Charles Miller</li>
  <li>Jake Stoss</li>
  <li>Ted Vollrath</li>
  <li>Jake Stoss, Jim Clark, Brenda Clark,  and Ted Vollrath</li>
</ul>


<p class="left">When I was 15 years old (in 1974) my parents dropped me off at a tournament at the Harrisburg Area Community College (HACC.) I didn’t know what I was doing and I was alone. No one from Lindquist’s York or Harrisburg dojos attended. That day I saw two karateka I’d never forget: Ted Vollrath and Jake Stoss.</>


<p class="left">Karate tournaments always begin with Black Belt kata. I saw some great kata, although some were new to me as they were Kung Fu. But, during the weapons competition, I saw one karate kata I’d never forget. This small man popped up in front of the senior black belt judges carrying his bo staff like it was a part of him. He oozed with confidence. After bowing deeply and slowly, he suddenly burst into action. His bo staff whizzed around him like helicopter blades. I recognized that kata. It was Isshinryu’s standard bo kata.</>


<p class="left">I didn’t find out till a decade later that the karateka was Jake Stoss. He was taught kata by none other than Ralph Lindquist. Jake was persuaded to start Karate training by Jim Clark when Jim was training undler Ralph Lindquist. Jim and Jake later ended up opening their own Karate school.</>


<p class="left">The other unforgettable man I met at that HACC tournament was Ted Vollrath. Ted was a student of Jake Stoss and Jim Clark. He had no legs. He performed an amazing demonstration that day. First, his wheelchair had arms that, when pulled, lifted out with knives. Us unarmed combat efficianados might consider knives cheating but Ted, kniveless, would leap out of that chair, grab the gis of an assailant with one hand, pull himself up to head level, and whack the crap out of him with his other fist. His arms were massive. When on the ground Ted would scramble around doing vicious take downs and pulling himself between legs. He was pretty much unstoppable at his vantage point on the ground. Later that day, I bought a pair of nunchucku from Mr. Vollrath, who had a weapons stand at the tournament.</>


<img src="../images/ch 5 volrath-sensei-lipsetts.jpg" class="center"/>



<p class="left">Chuck Norris in his book “The Secret Power Within: Zen Solutions to Real Problems” wrote about Ted Vollrath. Ted was injured in the Korean war when a mortar shell shredded his legs. The legs had to be amputated. Vollrath wanted to learn karate but several instructors told him it was impossible and refused to take him as a student. Eventually Vollrath visited Jim Clark’s school. Jim took Vollrath to visit his esteemed instructor, Ralph Lindquist. Ralph asked to sit in Ted’s wheelchair. Ralph meditated while sitting in the chair for some time. As Norris quoted Ralph in his book, Ralph opened his eyes and said: “If you want it, it’s there. But you must want it badly.” Ted did want it badly and mastered martial arts. Eventually he starred in the Hollywood movie “Mr. No Legs.”</>


<p class="left">Jim Clark was an amazing martial artist. He had the fastest hands I’ve ever seen. He traveled to numerous tournaments with Jake Stoss and they always left with multiple trophies. Jim Clark was a police officer for Swatara Township, Pennsylvania. He once took out a gang of five. The story, as he tells it, was that he quickly dispatched the leader and his two closest henchmen.The remaining two (seeing the devastation caused by Clark’s blinding hand speed and powerful kicks) decided to revoke their gang responsibilities and quickly ran away.</>


<p class="left">Jimmy Carter gave Jim Clark and Jake Stoss a Presidential award for their effective hand to hand combat training they gave to numerous young military men before they were sent to fight Vietnam.</>


<p class="left">I can’t write about Jim Clark without mentioning Brenda Clark. Brenda was Jim’s niece. She was an athlete and began training under Ralph when she was 13. She was a tenacious student and acquired her black belt in 4 years. She was the only female student to receive a black belt from Lindquist. Brenda was a standout athlete in college. After college she became a Lower Paxton patrol cop, made detective, did DEA undercover work in Pittsburg, and eventually became a Federal Marshall. Interestingly, Brenda became one of the country's best polygraph testers. She was listed by the FBI as one of their top three polygraph testers.</>


<h2>Charles Miller</h2>

<img src="../images/ch 5 miller kumite tournament.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Sensei Miller competing in kumite</div>

<p class="left">Charles Miller is a Ralph Lindquist student of particular note to me as he was my first karate instructor.</>


<p class="left">Charles had interest in karate and took Tae Kwon Do lessons for a time while he was in the Air Force. Charles was an accomplished drummer and was a member of the prestigious Air Force Drum and Bugle corps. After leaving the military, Charles, by chance, discovered Ralph’s Isshinryu school in Camp Hill Pennsylvania. At his first lesson, Ralph showed Charles one punch. Miller practised that punch for several classes before Ralph showed him a front kick. Charles worked on the reverse punch front kick for several weeks before he was allowed to join the regular class and begin learning kata.</>


<p class="left">Ralph Lindquist had an affinity for interesting people. Charles Miller is interesting. He was a Senior Engineer at AMP Incorporated, a world leader in electrical and electronic connection devices and interconnection systems. As of 2020, Miller has been a member of the Glen Rock Carolers for sixty-four years. For the past 170 years, the carolers have dressed in Dickenson garb with top hats and frock coats and walk the streets of Glen Rock Pennsylvania caroling. Charles is also an avid student of German history. In the 1970s he became interested in the rustic style of Southern Bavarian German dancing, known as shoe slapping. He procured the proper training and began a dance team. When Ralph first saw Miller’s shoe slapping dance group he said: “That’s Kata.” I saw Miller’s group perform several times myself and I was awestruck.</>


<p class="left">One of Ralph’s teaching strategies that deeply impressed Sensei Miller was that Lindquist started training students to be teachers themselves right from the beginning. When you were an upper belt, you trained the lowerbelts. Sensei Miller was a great instructor. Besides having us do bone-bruising training exercises and techniques, Miller taught us anatomy. He’d bring in a big cork board and he’d detail the bone structure of human anatomy. We listened attentively because we knew we’d receive questions on anatomy when testing for our next belt. Miller also taught us how to properly fold and carry our gis explaining the Okinawan and Japanese philosophy of tidiness. When attending tournaments, I felt an odd feeling of superiority as my gis was properly folded and wrapped into a neat tube with my belt tied around it and cooly draped over my shoulder.</>


<p class="left">After training under Lindquist in the Camp Hill dojo for a few years, Miller, who lived in York Pennsylvania, started a class in York. One winter Charles was in a severe snowmobile accident. His back was broken and he had a cast from his neck to past his hips. He asked Lindquist to travel to York and take over leading the class. Ralph asked him: “Can you walk?” Charles said: “Yes.”. Ralph responded: “Then you can teach class.” Despite admonishing Miller to teach the class himself, Ralph did come down. He gave Charles personal instruction on movements he could do under the constraints of the cast. But Miller still led the class. Miller credits his karate training for helping him recover in less than half the time predicted by doctors.</>


<p class="left">Ralph and Charles became great friends. As I cover in detail in the next chapter, Ralph was Charles’s best man for his wedding.</>

<h2>Art Hettinger</h2>
<p class="left">Art was another Lindquist black belt of note. Not only did he advance in rank and was a good instructor himself, his family was close with Ralph’s. His kids were like grandchildren to Ralph and Beverly. In fact, Art’s kids called Ralph and Beverly Grandpa and Grandma. Ralph never had children but he loved kids. Every year Lindquist wrote a huge check to the Cub Scouts of America.</>

<h2>Jim Brown</h2>
<p class="left">Jim Brown was an early student of Ralph’s. Jim became an adurent student of Buddhism as well as Isshinryu. Ralph loved Jim. Jim had been a national level golden gloves champion. Once he mastered Karate he was all but unstoppable at tournaments. Unbeknownst to everyone but Ralph, Jim had a dependency on hard drugs. All too early in his life he overdosed.</>

<h2>Ron Lawrence</h2>
<img src="../images/ch 5 ron lawrence Black Belt Mag May 70 a.png" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Ron Lawrence (far left) Grand Champion Black Belt Kata and Kumite</div>

<p class="left">I had heard about the famous Ron Lawrence for several years before I met him. In the late 1970s and early 1980s Ron began, somewhat regularly, traveling from his home in New Jersey to, once again, attend Lindquist’s classes. It was my pleasure to work out with that legend. I call him a legend because he was a Ralph Lindquist black belt that spent several years training in Japan and eventually won a prestigious national level tournament.</>


<p class="left">Ron began training with Ralph in 1967. In researching for this book I discovered multiple issues of Black Belt magazine listing Ron as tournament winner. In a 1969 issue he won green belt kata, weapons, and fighting at a huge tournament. Then in 1970 he won kata, weapons, and fighting in the brown belt division. Then, later that same year, he was grand champion of several large tournaments. Grand Champion is a black belt that won in all three divisions: fighting, kata, and weapons. I’ve taken first place in black belt kata and weapons on several occasions but I never took the whole thing by winning first in fighting as well.</>


<p class="left">Ron was a black man. He had a masters degree in math from Howard university. One story Ralph told about Ron was that they were at a tournament and the judges were refusing to call points when Ron was blasting his opponent with punches to the ribs. The judges obviously wanted their white champion to win. Despite not calling points for Ron’s punches, they had to stop the match several times so Ron’s poor opponent could recover from the punches no one, apparently, saw. Ralph matter of factly told them, he’s going to continue punching right through him unless you start calling points.</>



<p class="left">Ron’s first wife was a big proponent of the Black Panthers. Ron began to become more involved with that organization. At one point things were becoming too serious and Ralph walked into one of the Black Panther meetings and pulled Ron out to speak with him. Can you imagine a five foot two inch blond man walking into a Black Panther meeting? I’m not sure if the complexities with the Black Panther society were a cause, but in the early 1970s Ron divorced his wife, quit his high paying job as an IBM mainframe salesman, and moved to Japan.</>


<p class="left">One last story about Ron. He had a brown belt student that he’d sometimes bring to class. This “little” guy had been an NFL lineman for several years. Yeah, he was big. But he was extremely soft spoken and gentle. His movements were typically slow. He really enjoyed karate training. He once attended a tournament that we both competed in. I was in the green belt division and he was in the brown belt group. He ends up being matched up against another huge man. This guy was so big he had to cut the sleeves off his gis as his arms were too massive. He was overly aggressive and started to bear down hard on our ex-NFL karateka. That’s when I discovered that the biggest NFL linemen are faster and more athletic than I had ever imagined. The serious attack from a man his size woke something in him. It was like he was back on the 5 yard line and he opened up on his big opponent. His kicks were higher than I had ever seen him throw and his punches were blinding fast. His poor opponent did not stand a chance. The cool thing was, our NFL-karateka had subsequent matches with average sized men, and he was back to slow and easy. He lost matches out of kindness and an understanding of what he was capable of doing.</>


<p class="left">There were numerous other Ralph Lindquist black belts from the sixties that I have not elaborated on. These include Clyde Randoff, Bob Raphon, Doc Howell, Jake Stone, and Bill Moore.</>

<h2>Industry Luminaries</h2>

<p class="left">In researching this book I read or was otherwise orally recounted stories about Ralph’s relationship with many Karate luminaries. These include:</>

<ul>
  <li>Danny Pai</li>
  <li>Ed Parker</li>
  <li>Jhoon Rhee</li>
  <li>Robert Trias</li>
  <li>George Dillman</li>
  <li>George Iberl</li>
  <li>Steve Armstrong</li>
  <li>Don Nagle</li>
  <li>Harold Long</li>
</ul>


<p class="left">I found or was given numerous photos with Ralph working alongside these guys in some of the earliest Karate tournaments in the country. All of these men worked hard to develop names (highly googleable) for themselves and most had full careers as internationally known and respected Karate sensei.</>

<img src="../images/ch 5 trias bohan pai ralph.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Robert Trias, Don Bohan, Danny Pai, and Ralph Lindquist</div>


<p class="left">Danny Pai was probably the closest to Ralph of the other luminaries listed. Danny came from an asian martial arts family. He was the grandmaster of Pai Lum Kung Fu. I knew several martial artists that studied Pai Lum Kung Fu. One of those Pai Lum students told me a story of seeing Danny Pai give a demonstration where he would catch a sword being slashed at him between the two palms of his hand.</>


<p class="left">Ralph and Danny often travelled together to tournaments. Ralph recounted a story to me where he and Danny drove to a New York city tournament in one of Ralph’s Rolls Royces. On one of New York streets a car full of young troublemakers were harassing Ralph and Danny with a bit of road rage. Danny told Ralph he had a plan. If the car cut them off, they’d both jump out and go to either side of the other car and pick them off as they come out. Ralph laughed as he told me this story and said to me: “I had my own plan. My plan was to drive off after Danny jumped out of the car.” Which is pretty funny considering Ralph would never do that and Danny (or Ralph) could have handled the whole group themselves anyway.</>


<p class="left">In another Danny Pai story, Ralph and Danny went to a Chinese restaurant after a tournament. They ate a hearty meal but, when the overly exorbitant check came, they realized they didn’t have enough money. They got into a discussion with management and eventually a man came out with a meat cleaver. Ralph and Danny decided to escape and ran out of the restaurant and down the street laughing crazily.</>


<p class="left">Danny Pai was once talking about advanced belt ranks and how to manage the overproliferation of rapidly advancing black belts. He suggested that for shodan (first degree) you cut off one finger. For nidan, you cut off a second finger. Ralph was among the group of industry luminaries Danny was speaking to. Ralph had put his arms behind his back, balled his fists up, and pulled them hidden up his gi sleeves. When Danny finished his discourse, Ralph held up his handless arms and said: “Meet your master Sensei Pai!”</>

<p class="left">Jhoon Rhee is recognized as the father of American Taekwondo. Jhoon Rhee was always amazingly fit. At seventy years old he would start his classes with 100 pushups. Starting in the early 1960s, Rhee had numerous tournaments in Washington DC. They were attended by karateka from across the country. Rhee was good friends with Bruce Lee, who often performed demonstrations at Jhoon’s tournaments. Jhoon got along great with Ralph. They were both avid gardeners and did their own lawn care.You could always tell when Ralph push-mowed his one acre lawn barefoot as he’d come to class with green feet. Rhee told Ralph a story about when he was working on his lawn in a prestigious Washington DC neighborhood. He was wearing traditional gardener clothes. A man drives by in a Mercedes and stops. He questions this asian lawn care worker about his gardening skills as he compliments him. Then he asked Jhoon how much the owner pays him for his work. Jhoon, with a straight face, told him: “He lets me sleep with his wife.”</>


<p class="left">Steve Armstrong, Don Nagle, and Harold Long were among the first Americans to train under Shimabuku Tatsuo. All were military and each had great respect for Ralph Lindquist. Armstrong, Nagle, and Long regularly hosted and attended tournaments where they collaborated with Lindquist. Whenever possible, Ralph shored up his Isshinryu knowledge by training with these three men.</>


<p class="left">The amazing thing about these martial arts luminaries is that Ralph existed as kind of a quiet phantom. He was a powerful figure in American martial arts fitting right in as he stood beside these other famous individuals. But Ralph Lindquist never looked for notoriety.</>
