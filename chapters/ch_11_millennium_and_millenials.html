<p class='left'>One day, in the early 2000s, Joe Lewis came bounding up the second floor steps of Tom Joerg’s dojo at which he was to present a seminar. To say Joe Lewis was well known is an understatement. Bruce Lee called Joe: <i>“The Greatest Karate Fighter Of All Time.”</i> Anyway, as he came bursting into the dojo, at the corner there were several dozen people encircling an older gentleman. Joe blurted out: <i>“Is that Ralph Lindquist? Is he still teaching?”</i> Yes, he was still teaching. Ralph Lindquist taught class until just before his death in 2015. If you consider he started teaching in 1961, that’s over half a century. </p>


<p class='left'>Sensei Lindquist stayed amazingly fit right up until his eighties. In 2005/06 he was leaving the Harrisburg YMCA through the side alley-way entrance. Now... no one should walk alone in the dark of night in that deep city alleyway. Especially a short and seemingly frail man in his late seventies. Anyway, Ralph told me that one night he sensed someone following him closely. Ralph quickened his step and so did the obscure figure. Then the man grabbed Ralph’s shoulder from behind. Ralph spun around and did his famous reverse punch to the man’s solar plexus. I know that punch. He used a hip swivel and thrust (he used to say <i>“push Nelly through the fence”</i>) and his big fist was hardened from years of manual labor and makawara work. Ralph would have also, to focus power, twisted his wrist upon impact. The man collapsed and didn’t get back up as Ralph hurried home.</p>

<h2>Sensei Bob Sprenkle</h2>


<p class='left'>Following the death of A.J. Boyd and with Sensei Lindquist living in Phoenix Arizona, the next highest belt in the class was Bob Sprenkle. Bob had been a member of the club since forever. To me, he was always older. When I was in my twenties, Bob was middle aged at forty or fifty.</p>


<p class='left'>Ralph once said to me: <i>“My students could fight anyone in the country and would put in at least a good showing.”</i> At the time he mentioned the names of Vito Coviello and Joe Salzinger but he was referring, as well, to myself, Bretz, and Kotzman. Ron Lawrence did compete at a world level in Japan. Jim Kotzman competed successfully in Russia. Me? I competed successfully in professional kickboxing and, as to kata, it got to the point, locally at least, where folks wouldn’t enter kata when they saw I was competing as they were pretty sure I’d take first. Bob Sprenkle was not an athlete. He loved Karate and religiously attended class and both learned and taught kata well. But he was not someone that could spar anyone in the country.</p>


<p class='left'>When Ralph asked Kotzman to test Bob for black belt, Jim had his doubts. Right before the test, Bob gave Sensei Kotzman a bottle of pills and explained, should he pass out, to put one under his tongue. Bob’s black belt exam did not contain the blood and guts typical of Lindquist black belt tests. Nevertheless -- with his knowledge of kata, self-defense techniques, and adequate fitness level -- Bob Sprenkle was awarded a black belt.</p>

<p class='left'>While living in Richmond Virginia, I was wondering about the quality of a Bob Sprenkle led class. In Fall of 2020 I started intermittently training Brian Shefflield to prepare him for a potential black belt test. Brian, and his brother Michael, had started training under Bob Sprenkle. I quickly discovered that Brian had been well trained. I asked Brian: <i>“With the myriad of Karate schools available, why did you choose the Bob Sprenkle led Isshinryu school?”</i> Brian told me that he and his brother Michael had visited a variety of local schools and they preferred the way Bob (and his co-instructor Patty Lipsett) taught and ran class.  When Sensei Bob discovered Brian and Michael did not own a car and were walking to class, he started driving them to and from class. Brian had this to say of Sensei Bob:</p>

<p class='left'>
  <i><i>“Sensei ran a strict class. If we were winding up, telegraphing our techniques with our bodies, being too tight, or not enough power he would retain you on the subject. Most times he would reteach and watch you execute it correctly. If it became a repeat issue he would just drop the class and make us do 25 knuckle push-ups. I vaguely remember one class doing 150 of them because we just weren’t performing as good as we should have been. He really stressed the use of hips and core in all your technique.”</i></i>

<p class='left'>Brian and Michael were happy with Bob’s class and the first time Ralph Lindquist visited from Phoenix and he sealed the deal. Ralph moved back to Camphill in 2010 and began attending and leading every class. Members of the Isshinryu Karate Association of Pennsylvania regularly visited other schools. At one point they visited a George Iberl dojo annex in Dillsburg. Ralph Lindquist was chatting with George Iberl as the brown belt Sheffield brothers more than held their own with Iberl’s advanced black belts. Ralph’s millennial group also visited Jake Stoss’s dojo. Brian showed me videos of Ralph leading class (post stroke) at Jake’s school. </p>
<p class='left'>Brian and Michael both obtained brown belts. Jim Kotzman was on their brown belt exam board. After their test, Sensei Kotzman approached them, complimented their technique, and offered to train them should they wish to drive to his York PA home dojo. Almost a decade later, they took Jim Kotzman up on that offer. </p>

<p class='left'>Brian was a kid when he first started training under Bob Sprenkle. Now he is a member of a special team in the Army's Ranger Regiment. He is stationed in Georgia. When he travels to visit family in Harrisburg he stops in Richmond VA for two days of training with me. Then, during his stay with his Harrisburg family, both Brian and his brother Michael visit Sensei Kotzman’s home dojo. Brian wants to learn everything he can about Lindquist Isshinryu and take a Ralph Lindquist black belt -- remember O-Sensei Lindquist said <i>“you take a black belt, you are not given one.”</i> Both Sensei Kotzman and I are ecstatic that the training we obtained from Ralph Lindquist is continuing with these millennials. </p>


<p class='left'>I covered Ralph Lindquist’s funeral in the prior chapter. The final chapter in this book about Sensei’s life isn’t final. That’s because Ralph Lindquist remains in the hearts and minds of many. The millennium may well end before Sensei Lindquist is forgotten. </p>
