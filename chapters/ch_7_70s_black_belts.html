  <h1>Chapter 7: Black Belts of the 1970s</h1>
</center>

<p class='left'>The most significant event of Ralph Lindquist’s instruction in the 1970s, from my perspective, was the promotion of four black belts in January of 1974: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Vito Coviello</li>
  <li>Bill Dollinger</li>
  <li>Frank Sciortino</li>
  <li>Dick Rupert</li>
</ul>

<p class='left'>Vito was from Mechanicsburg Pennsylvania but the other three were York Pennsylvania-based students of Charles Miller. Those three travelled to Harrisburg to train under Ralph as often as possible. All four men began training in the late 1960s and became exemplary martial artists in the 1970s.</p>


<p class='left'>Also occurring in early seventies was the introduction of Lord Beans, Ralph getting Sensei Miller arrested, and some serious swordplay at The York Little Theater.</p>

<h2>Vito Coviello</h2>

<img src="../images/ch 7 vito talking to ralph.jpg" class="center"</>
<div class="caption">Vito Coviello in a discussion with Sensei</div>

<p class='left'>Vito was a successful architect who appreciated the intellect and gentility of Ralph Lindquist. Vito began training under Ralph in 1968. I started training under Charles Miller in 1973 (when I was 13 years old) but, when I was of driving age, I began travelling to Ralph’s Harrisburg dojo once or twice a week. Typically Ralph would start the class but would then hand it over to Vito, who was an excellent, if demanding, sensei.</p>
<p class='left'>I drove up from York to Lindquist’s Enola school one Saturday so we could attend a tournament as a group. Vito Coviello was there along with three other students. We drew straws to see who would drive. I lost so the five of us climbed into my 1963 Ford Falcon. When we got to the tournament everyone knew Vito. The tourney started with a demo by one of the most fantastic karateka I've ever seen. At one point he had a student sit on the shoulders of another student and hold a board up high. He leaped up and did a spin hook kick in mid air and cracked a board dangling between two fingers. But, for kumite, he had to fight Vito Coviello for 1st place and, super flying hook kicks or not, he didn't crack that barrier. Vito beat him in kata as well.</p>
<p class='left'>I didn't place in my own division, but my Ford Falcon trunk was full of Ralph Lindquist enabled trophies, so it was a proud day for me.</p>
<p class='left'>Vito was never much impressed with my leg splits or fancy kicks but he worked with me. I'll never forget, one night, when I finally whacked an opponent's (all the Harrisburg  adversaries were hard) chest with a counter punch. Vito was watching and exclaimed: <i>"I knew you had it in you.”</i> That comment was huge for me.</p>
<p class='left'>Vito was tall and very slender. When he sparred he handled the job like a confident surgeon. Most of the burly upper belts at the Harrisburg dojo were more akin to butchers than surgeons. Vito would calmly keep big opponents at bay with reach, speed, and expertise. His long thin arms were like whips and his kicks seemed to snake in like cobra strikes. As an architect the purpose, structure, and detail of kata were important to him and he excelled at all Isshinryu kata.</p>
<p class='left'>Vito once said to me, when I was sixteen, of Lindquist “He’s an unheralded hero.” As a teenager that loved Bruce Lee movies and the Kung Fu TV series, Lindquist fit my hero mold. Now, at sixty, my perspective of Sensei Lindquist’s hero mold has a far different shape than when I was sixteen.  </p>
<p class='left'>I could not get Vito to boast of his tournament exploits. I had seen Vito dominate at one tournament and I knew he did well at others. Vito did recount one experience: He was matched up against a student from Harry Smith’s Pittsburg dojo. All of Smith's students were hard competitors. Vito won the extremely nasty bout, but it resulted in a visit to hospital emergency with a split esophagus and a broken thumb. The Doctor wanted to do a tracheotomy for Vito’s breathing and pin the thumb’s carpal. Vito claims that because of his “arrogance and stupidity” he had the Doctor merely set the bone and wrap it. And, instead of a tracheotomy, he gave Vito pills to prevent swelling of the tracheal cartilage. The Doctor promised Vito that, if lived to the age of seventy, he would regret not following his advice. Vito was over seventy when I interviewed him for this book and he admits the Doctor was spot on and that he still suffers pain in the throat and thumb.</p>
<p class='left'>Speaking of arrogance and stupidity… this time mine with a strong reference to Vito. Again, when I was sixteen, Vito told me a story of how he was at one of Ralph’s martial arts presentations. Ralph announced that one of his students, Vito Coviello, would break eight bricks with a knuckle punch. Vito did not want to refuse his sensei and Ralph smiled approvingly after he completed a clean break. Vito told me recently that he never tried it again and:  “At that time I was a young Architect trying to earn a living and solidify my career, and was admonished by my employer about breaking more bones in my hands.” As a teenager, I was impressed with the concept of Vito performing knuckle breaks. No one did that. What you normally saw was bricks broken with hammer or palm strikes. The soft pad on your palm manages the cement quite well. But you punch with your knuckles. So, yeah, teenager me was impressed. I started regularly performing knuckle breaks at demonstrations. I never got up to eight bricks and I regularly broke the bursa in my knuckles.</p>
<p class='left'>Vito’s career took him to Saudi Arabia. He started a dojo in Saudi Arabia as he architected castles as he applied his architectural profession for five years. He promoted at least one black belt in that period. Vito moved back to the US and, for a time, owned a successful avocado ranch. Vito continued his martial arts training and received an honorary YonDon from International Shorin Ryu Karate Kobudo Federation in January 2003 from Kenneth Lyle Penland, Hanshi.</p>

<p class='left'>Vito had this to say about Lindquist: “I was very fortunate to have had three mentors at different stages in my lifetime to point me to the correct pathways. The catalyst mentor was Ralph who brought all aspects of my life together into one mass and showed me how it all should work.  Read, understand and live  ‘The Isshinryu Code’.”</p>

<h2>Bill Dollinger</h2>

<img src="../images/ch 7 dollinger vito sparring.jpg" class="center"</>
<div class="caption">Bill Dollinger and Vito Coviello in a Sparring Session</div>

<p class='left'>Ralph Lindquist called Bill Dollinger “Bull Dollinger” because he was a huge man that didn’t move when he sparred until he charged. </p>
<p class='left'>When I started, in 1973, Bill was always at Charles Miller’s York dojo classes. He taught me the basics and my first half-dozen Isshinryu kata. He attended Ralph Lindquist(‘s) classes in Harrisburg regularly. When I was fifteen years old, Bill offered to pick me up and take me to Ralph’s classes. I’d walk several miles to sit by the highway waiting for Bill. Ralph’s class was, at that point, at a Fire Station in Mechanicsburg. Most of the students were adults.</p>
<p class='left'>At that point, Bill was a school bus driver. There was one kid he got a kick out of and coerced him to come to class at Miller’s dojo. That kid was Jim Kotzman -- who became a Lindquist standout. Jim tells stories of how, when kids would start to fight on his bus, Bill would stop the bus and arrange what amounts to cage matches where he’d supervise somewhat controlled fights. </p>
<p class='left'>Sometimes Jim Kotzman would come along on the Bill Dollinger trips to Ralph’s mechanicsburg class. I remember one class where Bill and several of the other students went to a bar after class. Joe Salzinger (a state trooper) went to get a pitcher of beer and the bartender gave glasses of a count that included us two fifteen year olds (who were both pretty much full grown at that time.) </p>
<p class='left'>The three York black belts would fight every week. Each seemed to have their day. One week Bill was the man, the next week, Dick Rupert, and the next it was Frank Sciortino that was top dog. One week, Bill put blanks in a pistol and stuffed it into the front of his gi. Bill started to spar Dick and he loudly exclaimed: ““I never liked you.” He then janked out his pistol and shot at Dick twice. Understand that this would shock anybody but to Dick, who was a policeman, this shocked him more than most as the prospect of getting shot is a reality police deal with on a daily basis. It's a good thing Dick considered BIll a great friend.</p>
<p class='left'>Bill certainly was a character. Charles Miller told me a story of when his supervising manager had  a stay in York. Miller knew his manager enjoyed visiting classy bars. Miller suggested they’d visit some of York’s local bars. Miller slyly asked Bill to come along and quietly suggested to Bill they show this guy some of the darker bars in York (which Bill knew quite well). So the trio gets to a dive where there were some seedy looking people milling outside. Bill exclaims: “I knew we’d have to fight our way out, but it looks like we will have to fight our way in as well.”</p>
<p class='left'>Bill said to me, in reference to Sensei Lindquist, several times over a course of decades: <i>“There will never be another like him.”</i> Curiously I’ve heard this same statement from other Lindquist students, most notably George Dillman. </p>

<h2>Frank Sciortino</h2>

<p class='left'>I don’t have any crazy Bull Dollinger-like stories about Frank. He was a fine upstanding man, a mailman in fact. </p>
<p class='left'>One day, before class, I was watching Frank performing a kata. That kata looked amazing and I wondered which advanced kata it was and when I might learn it. Then I realized it was one of the basic H-form katas. In that instant my whole attitude about kata changed. Every move was to be done with vigor. After that moment, I took the execution of all kata seriously. </p>
<p class='left'>Frank had one fighting technique where he’d rush in like he was going to throw a reverse punch. You’d wait a second for it to come then figure it was a fake so you’d start to launch your own strike. Then, when you were least expecting it, Frank would finally throw that reverse punch and whack you.</p>
<p class='left'>I remember asking Sensei Frank, when I was about fourteen years old, how I would ever be able not to flinch and overreact when I was attacked. Frank said I would adapt as I got older and that I had  to keep sparing regularly. He was right. As I got a few years older opponents would give me a black eye or bloody nose and I’d respond with a laugh.</p>
<p class='left'>Patty Lipsett related a funny story about Frank. He was attending one of Ralph’s classes at the Harrisburg YMCA. At that point the YMCA had moved the class to a room in the basement. It looked like a dungeon with pipes dangling on the ceiling. One pipe had a five gallon bucket hung on it to capture drips from a toilet above. Frank was unaware of the bucket’s purpose and performed a leaping front kick to it. As he was performing this impressive kick, Patty yelled a warning... but it was too late. Frank worked out the rest of the class without his gi top, which had been stained with toilet drippings. </p>

<h2>Dick Rupert</h2>

<img src="../images/ch 7 dick rupert.jpg" class="center"</>
<div class="caption">Dick Rupert and Myself in a Sparring Session</div>

<p class='left'>I could write a book about Dick Rupert. Dick was a cop for Northern York Pennsylvania Regional Police. I trained under Dick when I was a teenager and there were a half-a-dozen times where I got out of trouble with local police because I knew Dick Rupert. </p>
<p class='left'>When I was eighteen I got a job as a fitness instructor at Jim Dohm’s Health Club. Jim let police attend the gym free of charge. I’d be sleeping at the entryway desk in the afternoon and Dick Rupert would pop in. He’d snarl to me: <i>“Let’s spar.”</i> So I’d put on a gi or sweat pants and we’d battle in the free exercise gym. I do mean battle. At eighteen I was a pretty serious contender and Dick was one hard man. One day we slammed up against one of the six foot mirrors and smashed it. I always had problems sparring Rupert. As I began to compete well against other local talent, I started to think I just didn’t know how to fight Dick. But then I saw him spare a few of my non-Isshinryu notable black belt friends and I realized just how good Dick Rupert really was. I then acknowledged how much our sparring sessions helped me become adept.</p>

[photo of Dick and me at Dohms]


<p class='left'>Ralph Lindquist gave belt advancements formally at the beginning of test night, which was every other month. In 1977 Ralph advanced Vito to Sandon and Bill and Frank to Nidan. Dick Rupert was present at that class and did not receive advancement. Vito asked me weeks later if I thought Dick had been upset about not receiving Nidan. I told Vito that I didn’t think so but, whereas he, Bill, and Frank had all dedicated effort to teaching at the dojos, Dick was often absent. I continued to tell Vito that what Sensei may not know is that Dick Rupert had dedicated himself to providing self-defense classes to women. He gave those classes regularly in the York area. I knew because I’d show up to help (and then Dick would thank me by kicking my ass in after class sparring sessions.)</p>


<p class='left'>One day Rupert once came into Jim Dohm’s Health Club a little agitated. While on duty he had been called to a hospital where a big guy was getting overly physical and belligerent. Dick said he walked up to the guy and said softly <i>“Come on, let’s go.”</i> And then he put his right arm up like he was going to put it around him. Only it wasn’t an embracing arm wrap. It was a reverse back fist that hit the guy on his temple. The big man dropped straight down. Dick said to me: <i>“I thought I killed him.”</i> But the man was OK.</p>


    <p class='left'>I spoke with Dick Rupert at Ralph Lindquist’s funeral. Understand, though, that before we spoke, we kind of looked over each other silently saying: <i>“Come on. Right now. Let’s go.”</i> Of course we didn’t break out into battle, which is good as, although I was in my fifties and Dick was in his mid sixties, he was still fighting competitively -- we may have broken another mirror!</p>

<h2>Steve Angeli, Glenn Dively, and Joe Salzinger</h2>
<p class='left'>In the seventies Ralph’s dojo was full of exemplary brown belts. The three that are unforgettable to me are Steve Angeli, Glenn Dively, and Joe Salzinger.  Glenn Dively was a big hard man. He wasn’t great at kata but he loved to fight. It was one thing to have black belts that you knew could pick you apart but it was crazy when there were several two hundred pound or so brown belts that could easily break ribs and knock you out. It made for some pretty serious training. Joe was a Pennsylvania State policeman that I covered in the prior chapter. Steve Angeli began training under Ralph when he was a teenager with little focus. Karate gave him focus. Besides becoming a winning competitor at tournaments, he became a state level sprinter. Those fast and powerful legs made his kicks amazing. I emulated my kicks after his. The focus he acquired from martial arts helped Steve become a heart surgeon. I recall Vito saying: “Steve came to this dojo a boy and left a man.”</p>

<h2>A Marine Challenge</h2>


<p class='left'>In the mid seventies, when Ralph’s dojo was still at the refurbished bar, a trio of hot shot Marine graduates stopped by what they thought was still a bar. They watched class for a bit then rudely called out a challenge to fight. The heavy hitters of Salzinger, Dively, Bretz, or Vito must not have been there that night. Ralph told them they’d have to wait until after class. A. J. Boyd, a white belt at that time, waited outside while these rough recruits showed the karate instructor (whom they had no idea was a decorated special forces war hero) how tough they were. Ralph quickly put one man down, then a second. To the third he said: “Do you want to spar or carry your friends out?” He did the smart thing and helped his Marine buddies out of the bar-turned-dojo. This “wait till after class” was apparently a thing with Ralph. Miller told me similar stories from the sixties. In one story a big guy waited till after class. He had a pack of cigarettes in his shirt pocket. The first technique Ralph threw was a roundhouse that crushed the cigarettes. </p>

<h2>Lord Beans </h2>


<p class='left'>Lord Beans (otherwise known as the Isshinryu dog) was Lindquist’s beloved Boston Terrier. When Ralph would come home from class clad in his gi, Lord Beans would grab his obi and Ralph would spin Bean around in mid-air. Sensei always treated Beans like a gentleman. He would grome him weekly. As Ralph neatly trimmed his whiskers, Beans would sit motionless. Vito remembers Ralph flipping Beans a bottle cap and, in about 5 minutes, he would spit out a flat piece of metal that resembled a nickel.  </p>


<p class='left'>Lord Beans was also known as the Isshinryu dog because he was a gift from Charles Miller’s York dojo. Ralph had lost a Boston Terrier called Fendle. He was half-heartedly adamant about not getting another. But Miller collaborated with Ralph’s wife, Beverly, and they contacted a breeder. Boston Terriers require cesarean sections for 80% of births so they are expensive and are often hard to acquire. Miller’s York Isshinryu club had one heart and mind and all contributed to the purchase of the Boston Terrier that  Ralph named Lord Beans (for Boston baked beans.)</p>

<h2>The Samurai of York Little Theater </h2>

<p class='left'>I was once at one of my wife’s family gatherings. Her family was more into music and theater than sports (much less martial arts.) Anyway, at that gathering I met a man who was a regular actor at the York Little Theater. Of course, I mentioned karate and this fellow asked if I knew Ralph Lindquist. What? This short, dumpy, thespian, singer, musician knew Ralph Lindquist? He explained that he was in a play that required a sword fight. They asked around for someone that could choreograph and train them. Ralph Lindquist was recommended. Ralph travelled to York and choreographed a detailed sword fight. The audience was shocked: in that scene sparks were flying during the sword fight and the audience was astounded -- they were expecting swordplay and not a real sword fight.</p>
<p class='left'>I’ve heard other stories of Ralph giving his time to work with people he otherwise had no relationship with. I’m sure there are many others. I’ll give you another quick one: Patty Lipsett once saw a Rolls Royce stretch limo sitting in front of the Blue Cross Blue Shield building. It had a chauffeur leaning dutifully against the driver’s door.  Patty couldn’t resist and asked the chauffeur if the battery was in the boot in that model (that way he’d know she was familiar with Rolls). They got into a conversion and she learned the Rolls belonged to the owner of Vartan Group (a huge real estate firm). It turns out that Vartan personally asked Ralph Lindquist to teach his chauffeur some self-defense and bodyguard moves.  </p>

<h2>Charles Miller’s Arrest</h2>

<p class='left'>Ralph and Charles had been close friends since the mid 1960s. Ralph was Charles’s best man. Ralph arraigned for Charles to be arrested after the wedding rehearsal. A huge policeman cornered Charles and asked him to get in his patrol car so he could take him downtown for questioning. Charles refused. But Ralph, the nice man that he was, said he’d go along to the station with him and they’d sort things out quickly. So Ralph and Charles pop into the patrol car that drove them, not to the police station, but to a bachelor's party. I was barely sixteen, but I was at that party. </p>
<p class='left'>At the wedding the next day, many attendees wore traditional German outfits. At the reception, Miller was given a beer stein that was probably three feet tall and full of brew. He was told, for good luck, the custom was the stein must be emptied. Everyone helped. I had a go myself (again, I was 16.) But I’ll never forget Sensei Lindquist in a deep sei-uchin stance holding that monstros beer stein on one elbow and assisting in the cause of good luck. </p>
<p class='left'>Ralph Lindquist and his wife Beverly actually went on Charles Miller and his new wife MaryLou’s honeymoon to Germany. I remember Ralph telling me: “You can drink a different beer there everyday and never try them all.” Knowing Ralph wasn’t a drinker, I asked him: “How many did you try?” He said: “Oh, we tried all of them.”</p>
