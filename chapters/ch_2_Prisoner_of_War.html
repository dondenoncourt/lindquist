<p class='left'>Ralph Lindquist and his fellow 1st cavalry GIs that had been captured by Chinese Communication Forces (CCF) were put on forced marches to the prison camps. They were poorly fed and had no blankets. Ralph spoke about a friend that was so exhausted he fell asleep on damp hay one night. The next morning he was frozen stiff. Others could not keep up the march due to injury or severe dysentery. The CCF soldiers encouraged them to keep up by beating them and, eventually, they’d be left behind and would freeze to death.</p>
<p class='left'>Most died while at the camps. How could this happen? We’ve all heard about the Geneva Convention and its international laws for the humane treatment of wounded or captured military personnel, medical personnel, and non-military civilians during war or armed conflicts. North Korea had delivered signed documents to the UN stating that they would follow the Geneva Convention guidelines.</p>
<p class='left'>But it wasn’t North Koreans that hosted most of the Korean War POW camps, it was China. China did not believe in the Geneva Convention laws. They felt it was a capitalist, war-mongering, and bourgeois document. They adhered to the approach they called the Chinese Lenient Policy. They were lenient on their prisoners because they were unaware that capitalism was bad and communism was the right way. Rather than simply killing their captives they would do the better thing and provide a reeducation process. </p>
<p class='left'>The strategy of reeducation included prepping the prisoners with months of malnourishment. It was basic Pavlovian conditioning, where, in preparation for their propaganda lessons on the “Wall Street War”, they’d first starve their guests then reward them for signing documents denouncing the United Nations and Capitalism.</p>
<p class='left'>Because of their standard food, GIs referred to their new homes as Bean Camps.Twice daily they’d get baseball sized cakes of soya bean, whole-kernel corn, millet, and koaliang (unsweet sorghum American farmers feed to cattle.) The cakes amounted to 400 grams of food per day or about 1,600 calories. To give you an idea of 1,600 calories, consider that the overweight President Eisenhower was once put on a bed ridden diet of 1,600 quality calories -- and  lost weight. The American prisoners, however, were given cracked corn cakes that should have been cooked for 24 hours. Anything less would cause diarrhea (which many GIs ultimately died from.) Furthermore, the water they used for cooking and drinking came from contaminated wells. The GIs lacked energy to collect wood for cooking so they usually cooked the corn for one hour.</p>
<p class='left'>Meanwhile, North Korean and Chinese POWs held in South Korean camps gained weight.</p>
<p class='left'>Many US POWs had been captured in December 1950. When numbers increased in February, the diet was reduced to 1,200 calories.  </p>
<p class='left'>In the Fall of 1951, captors, in a meager attempt to improve nutrition, gave the GIs cabbages and told them to put the leaves out to dry on the compound roofs so they’d have greens for the winter. GIs used leaves to spell out P O W in big letters. Of course, that was discovered and stopped. Regardless, on the first snow, they trampled P O W in the snow in the compound yard. POW camps, by Geneva Convention rule, were obligated to put signs on camp roofs to identify locations. When GIs complained to captors, they were told UN forces would bomb the shelters. </p>
<p class='left'>The American GI doctors that were in the camps have documented the mental downturns that resulted from malnourishment and despair. One thing they wrote about was that the POWs often lost the ability to speak. Many could not remember the names of people in their family. </p>

<h2>Armistice</h2>

<p class='left'>General Ridgway did a great job turning around the virtual retreat UN forces had been put on when China entered the war. As the war turned into a grinding stalemate, both sides began talking armistice. Yet the war continued. One of the big issues in armistice talks was that a large percentage of North Koreans POWs held by South Korea and UN forces did not want to be repatriated and return home. After two years of negotiations, Operation Big Switch, as it was called, began. A couple of months before the Big Switch,  CCF POW camps began fattening up their prisoners. They added steamed rice, wheat bread, vegetables, and fatty soup to the standard diet.</p>
<p class='left'>But Ralph was not among the formally released and repatriated POWS. He was in a group of POWs being sent via train to China. Ralph had said that his fellow POWs were thrown “one on top of another” into cattle cars.  He said that several soldiers simply gave up and died in the cattle car. That train was thankfully intercepted by UN Forces and the POWs were rescued.  </p>
<p class='left'>I believe Ralph shared this part of his POW experience to teach that one should never give up. He never shared in the other atrocities he endured. Most of the information I gathered for this chapter was from interviews, articles, and books on Korean POWs.</p>
<p class='left'>Charles Miller related a story which suggests some of the pain Ralph endured as a POW. Miller, Lindquist, and their wives vacationed in Germany together in the mid 1970s. Charles was an avid German historian and wanted to visit the Dachau Nazi concentration camp. He suggested they could skip that portion of the trip or he could go alone. </p>
<p class='left'>Ralph insisted he wanted to visit Dachau. The Dachau camp had been reanimated in the early 1970s. They had the bunk rooms set up exactly as they had been during WWII. The walls include numerous pictures donated by Jewish families. There was an area for shooting prisoners. The two couples began discussing the scenarios. But Ralph hung back. He became very quiet. That was one time Charles Miller had seen Ralph show emotion. Ralph got very melancholy. He seemed to be in an out of body experience. Perhaps feeling the concentration of Jewish and subsequent deaths were too close to what Ralph had experienced. I can only imagine what the Jews went through but Ralph experienced something all too similar. </p>
<p class='left'>Anyway, Ralph Lindquist dealt with some horrendous and appalling conditions. He learned to deal with it, and went on to help others. Sensei joked that he lost the ability to speak as a POW, but, after the hospital got him speaking again, he never stopped talking.</p>
