  <h1>The Cornerman: Who was this guy?</h1>
</center>

<img src="../images/ch 0 the cornerman.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Sensei Lindquist, the cornerstone of Pennsyvanian Karate</div>

<p class='left'>Karate was huge in the 1970s. In the late seventies Joe Lewis, a Shorin-ryu stylist and a champion of traditional karate, promoted and competed in the 1st Pro Team Karate Championships. Joe called it Full Contact Karate but it was promoted as kickboxing. Joe won his fight by knockout in the second round. Lewis defended his U.S Heavyweight champion title ten times. Kickboxing became huge as the matches were more dramatic as a spectator sport than traditional karate point fighting.</p>
<p class='left'>All over the country kick boxing matches quickly began to be organized. In York, Pennsylvania a heavily promoted event was presented at Sheraton Inn York Ballroom on April 13, 1986. To procure fighters the promoters sought out the best competitive traditional martial artists in Pennsylvania. Fighters always had their karate instructor as one of their two cornermen. That fight card uncharacteristically included three martial artists from the same dojo. Most of the karate instructor cornermen were imposing figures in their 30s or 40s. But the instructor of the three fighter dojo was a short, unassuming man that was easily in his 60s.</p>
<p class='left'>Who was this cornerman? He had driven to the match in a Rolls Royce that had a prisoner of war license plate. Attendees continually approached him, bowed, spoke to him briefly,and shook his hand. In fact, before one of the matches, one of the challenger's instructors came across the ring to bow deeply at this unimposing, aging man. </p>
<p class='left'>The man was Ralph G. Lindquist. He was certainly more than just a cornerman. Pennsylvania is known as the Keystone State. Ralph was the keystone of Karate in Pennsylvania. He operated the first (non-profit, incorporated) Karate dojo opened in Pennsylvania and he managed many of the first Karate tournaments in PA. He was a decorated veteran of the Korean War and was part of the very first Special Forces. He was also a prisoner of war. Following the war, Ralph attended the Nicheren Buddhist temple in Japan and became a Buddhist priest. In the sixties Ralph Lindquist was a Karate pioneer  on the East Coast.</p>
<p class='left'>I wrote this book to honor Ralph Lindquist. I trained under Sensei Lindquist from 1973 through 1993. I also trained under or met many of Ralph’s original Black Belts. And, yes, I was one of his three students that was on the kick boxing fight card. I’m extremely proud to say Ralph Lindquist was not only my cornerman, but my sensei and mentor. My O-Sensei. Ralph Lindquist had an amazing life and I hope this book portrays some of his greatness. As several people have told me -- there will never be anyone else like him.</p>

<p class="left">Heroes of a ‘lost’ war are considered heroes by their fellow GIs but not by the general public. Ralph Lindquist was a hero of a forgotten war. During the Korean war, Ralph was a member of the United States Army’s First Cavalry Division, 16th Reconnaissance Unit. During the war, he was awarded the Combat Infantryman's Badge, the United Nations Ribbon with five campaign stars, the Order of the Purple Heart, the Presidential Unit Citation as well as three medals from the Korean Government, presented by then South Korean President, Sygmund Rhee.</>


<p class="left">In January of 1950, secretary of state Dean Acheson made a grievous mistake when he publicly defined a defensive perimeter against the Communist menace in Asia. That perimeter was based upon an island defense line includingJapan, Okinawa, and the Philippines. However, Acheson neglected to mention Korea. North and South Korea are split at the 38th parallel separating the communist North from the democratic South. Kim Il Sung, the founder and leader of North Korea, wanted nothing more than to ‘liberate’ the people of South Korea and create a unified communist Korea. Acheson’s faux pas was the catalyst that sparked the Korean war[a].</>


<p class="left">A handful of autocrats inflamed that initial spark into the full fledged Korean War. First among these were the Communist overlords Kim Il Sung, Mao Zedong, and Joseph Stalin. Then there was the Democratic totalitarian Syngman Rhee, leader of Democratic South Korea. He was a monocrat that wanted to take over North Korea. There was yet one more autocrat in this dance who fanned the smouldering embers of conflict into an out of control wildfire, the United States hero of the World War Two Pacific Conflict, Douglas MacArthur. Many argued that MacArthur enjoyed functioning as the American appointed Chancellor of post-war Japan; kind of a modern version of the omnipotent Shogun of Japan’s past.</>


<p class="left">Mao Zedong liberated (his perspective) China in 1948 when he defeated Chiang Kai-Shek’s army and established the People’s Republic of China. Kim wanted to do for North Korea what Mao had done for China and unite all of Korea. Kim was sure the South Koreans were simply waiting to be invaded, upon which they would immediately join North Korea’s communist forces. When conferred for support, Stalin surmised that, since the US had not come to Chiang Kai-Shek’s aid, they were equally unlikely to come to Syngman Rhee’s aid.</>


<p class="left">Power hungry autocrats aside, this was a war played out by teenagers who lost the last remnants of their childhood in battles among the mountains of Korea, along with thousands killed and wounded or frostbitten toes and their very lives in battle. A war that called aging US WWII vets back to active duty, pulling them away from their families and thrusting them back into combat. A war watched closely by zealous Russian, Chinese, and Korean communists  but mostly ignored by uninterested Americans.</>


<p class="left">Kim Il Sung sought the approval and support required to attack South Korea from Joseph Stalin, the Premiere of the Soviet Union, and Mao Zedong, the chairman of the Communist party in China. Consent, firearms, and equipment obtained, on June 25th 1950, Kim Il Sung crossed the 38th parallel and launched a rather successful attack against South Korea.</>

<h2>The Communist Bloc</h2>


<p class="left">The United States was very concerned about the post WWII strength of the Communist Bloc, the communist satellite nations under the hegemony of the Soviet Union. With Germany, Italy, France, and other western european Democratic countries effectively disabled by WWII, the Communist Bloc was a concerning threat. The US put out a call to service for citizens to enlist to fight communism. But whereas kids had readily volunteered to fight Hitler’s Germany and the Japanese that bombed Pearl Harbor, they were reluctant to fight in a war against an unknown and misunderstood enemy. The draft was reinstated.</>


<p class="left">Ralph Lindquist was barely 21 when the Korean war began. He was a hard working son of a blue collar family from Scranton Pennsylvania that had somehow opened his own auto garage. But Scranton, which had at one time been a thriving community due to the coal mining and steel industries, was in an economic downturn.</>


<p class="left">Ralph Lindquist believed strongly in the United States. He wanted to make a difference. He enlisted in the Army. He became part of the 16th Reconnaissance for the 1st Cavalry. He was heavily trained in what is known today as Special Forces. His training included Jiu-Jitsu and Judo for the hand-to-hand combat that was often required for the typically solitary task of reconnaissance.</>

<h2>Warfare Against North Koreans</h2>


<p class="left">Ralph Lindquist did not arrive in Korea until October of 1950. Until that point things weren’t going so well for the United States’ defense of South Korea.</>


<p class="left">General MacArthur made many mistakes in the Korean war, but perhaps his greatest battle success (including even his WWII accomplishments) was the battle of Inchon with its daring but lucky marine landing. I say “daring but lucky” because both Stalin and Mao were sure that the USA would do a marine landing and there was one obvious place to do that. Furthermore, with the predictability of ocean tides, it was relatively easy to guess what would be the most appropriate time for a landing. Kim, who did not like or respect Mao, did not believe the US would brave a marine landing. However, land they did, with a fighting force of 75,000 troops and 261 naval vessels. The battle quickly led to the recapture of Seoul, the capital of South Korea.</>


<p class="left">MacArthur, invigorated by his huge success at Inchon, promptly decided to order his generals to take full control of the entirety of North Korea.</>

<h2>The March to the Yalu</h2>


<p class="left">This movement of UN forces from South Korea to North Korea came to be known as “The March to the Yalu”. The Yalu is the river that delineates the border between China and North Korea.</>


<p class="left">US politicians would have preferred MacArthur simply move a bit north of the 38th and block any attempts for the Inmin Gun to move back into South Korea. Instead MacArthur wanted to liberate North Korea.</>


<p class="left">MacArthur was absolutely sure China would not enter the war. And, even if they did, the intelligence he received told him China had as little as 20,000 troops, with a ceiling of 70,000.</>


<p class="left">But there were a couple of problems with the March to the Yalu. First, the winter of 1950 was the coldest in 100 years  and it came three weeks early. Second, the mountainous terrain of North Korea was endless, preventing mobility, communications, and the delivery of supplies. Third, the UN force spread themselves out too thin to protect from coordinated attacks. And finally, China had seven hundred thousand (not 20,000 or 70,000) highly trained troops ready.</>

<h2>China’s invasion</h2>


<p class="left">China bristled at United Nations troops at their border. Furthermore, Mao did not trust MacArthur. The Chinese took military control  away from Kim Il Sung and invaded North Korea on October 19th, 1950. That sheer size of the invasion took UN forces almost completely by surprise. Once the vastly underestimated Chinese Comunist Forces (CCF) troops crossed the Yalu, the battles that ensued were fierce and UN forces were put on retreat. Typically, battles ended merely because the Chinese supply channels were poor and they simply needed to acquire food and ammunition.</>


<p class="left">Matthew Ridgway was  put in command of the Eighth United States Army early in 1951. At that point the Eighth was an army that was in serious tactical retreat. Ridgway insisted on having command posts know where the Chinese were and estimates of their numbers. He’d visit a post and inspect maps that had red flags pinned where the commander understood Chinese to be. Ridgway would ask the commanding officer the last time reconnaissance had ascertained CCF location and numbers. At first they’d say a week or two ago. At that point Ridgway would take the flag off and say “If you haven’t verified within the past 24 hours, you don’t know”. After a while the posts had updated information -- or Ridgway would replace the commanding officer.</>


<p class="left">That’s what Ralph Lindquist was trained to do: reconnaissance. In the coldest winter in the last 100 years, it was the job of the 1st Calvary’s 16th Reconnaissance team to ascertain how many of the hundreds of thousands of CCF troops were lurking nearby.</>

<p class="left">Like most Korean war vets, Ralph rarely talked about his experiences. Vets don’t want to share their misery. But, every now and again, a piece would come out. In the late 70s we used to canoe down the Susquahanna river, camping on islands during the night. We’d ask Sensei to come and he’d decline. I remember saying the weather would be good but he said he knew how to deal with cold. He explained how he would ball up his socks every night in Korea and put them in his armpits to warm them up and dry them out. He did have all his toes even though I know now that many Korean war veterans lost several due to frostbite.</>


<p class="left">At a 1960s karate picnic, someone brought a brace of shotguns and a box of clay pigeons. When Ralph took a turn, he never missed. He was asked if he skeet shot regularly. He said he had never done it before. What he was familiar with was, he said. was known as the  “big gun” of the M1 Garand, It’s a bit surreal when you consider that Ralph acquired that clay pigeon mastery on live targets in Korea.</>


<p class="left">Later, at that same picnic, after some inquiries from Charles Miller, Ralph related a story. He said that his superior had spotted two Chinese officers in a nearby mountain. He gave Ralph the assignment of taking out those two officers. UN Forces had discovered that, while CCF troops were great fighters, they were often unable to adapt when their officers were gone. Miller asked if Ralph “got them”. Ralph said he succeeded in his mission. That’s all he said. Now, you just don’t go and take out two officers. You have to go through others to get to them.</>


<p class="left">Another alarming fact came from Ralph directly to me. He was irritated about a Black Belt magazine article on a highly publicized Karate instructor. The article said that this fellow had been training in Karate since the 1940s. He claimed he began his karate training when he lived in Germany and was part of the Hitler Youth program. Part of the program was to teach them self-defense. Understand that this somewhat famous Karate instructor’s first sensei was Ralph Lindquist, hence Ralph’s irritation. Ralph expounded: “I was strangling Chinese with piano wire in Korea in 1950 and I didn’t call that Karate”. Charles Miller confirmed the story saying he had spoken to Ralph about the use of such ghastly garrotes in Korea.</>


<p class="left">Ralph Lindquist had an odd quirk for a martial arts instructor, he abhorred wrestling. Many of us had wrestled in high school and college and enjoyed it when sparring matches ended up on the ground. We were reluctant to stop. But Ralph would sneer: “No wrestling”. And Ralph rarely sneered. So even when we benefited from wrestling matts at the YMCA we trained at, we never continued on the ground. After learning about Sensei’s Korean exploits and training, I think our “wrestling” reminded him too much of his grim and fatal experiences of ground fighting with garrotes and knives.</>


<p class="left">One story that was related to me during my research was that Ralph spent three weeks in a psychiatric ward in Korea. He had developed a severe stutter. I considered not mentioning this story but then I realized it illustrates that Ralph wasn’t some kind of fictional superman played on film by Chuck Norris or Arnold Schwarzenegger. Ralph Lindquist was but 21 to 22 years old. Stuff got to him. After his three week sojourn, he was sent right back to the front line.</>


<p class="left">General Ridgway was successful. He effectively turned an all out UN retreat into a stalemate. The UN, North Korea, and China began speaking of an Armistice in mid 1951. However, there were issues. Perhaps the biggest issue was the repatriation of prisoners of war. Some sixty percent of the extremely well treated Chinese and North Korean POWs held by UN forces did not want to go back to their native countries.</>


<p class="left">Despite armistice discussions, brutal fighting continued for 2 more years. Early in the conflict, Ralph Lindquist was captured by CCF.</>

<p class="left">Sensei Lindquist rarely spoke about his time as a prisoner of war. He sometimes recounted that the CCF piled them into train cattle cars and some of the GIs just gave up and later died. That short description, while giving the gravity of the situation, leaves out a lot of detail. The quick story is that, out of 7,000 US prisoners, 2,800 (40%) died in captivity. The following chapter provides more detail about the miserable conditions and deplorable treatment Ralph Lindquist endured and, thankfully, survived.</p>

<center>
  <h1>Prisoner of War</h1>
</center>

<div class="caption">

</div>

<p class='left'>Ralph Lindquist and his fellow 1st cavalry GIs that had been captured by Chinese Communication Forces (CCF) were put on forced marches to the prison camps. They were poorly fed and had no blankets. Ralph spoke about a friend that was so exhausted he fell asleep on damp hay one night. The next morning he was frozen stiff. Others could not keep up the march due to injury or severe dysentery. The CCF soldiers encouraged them to keep up by beating them and, eventually, they’d be left behind and would freeze to death.</p>
<p class='left'>Most died while at the camps. How could this happen? We’ve all heard about the Geneva Convention and its international laws for the humane treatment of wounded or captured military personnel, medical personnel, and non-military civilians during war or armed conflicts. North Korea had delivered signed documents to the UN stating that they would follow the Geneva Convention guidelines.</p>
<p class='left'>But it wasn’t North Koreans that hosted most of the Korean War POW camps, it was China. China did not believe in the Geneva Convention laws. They felt it was a capitalist, war-mongering, and bourgeois document. They adhered to the approach they called the Chinese Lenient Policy. They were lenient on their prisoners because they were unaware that capitalism was bad and communism was the right way. Rather than simply killing their captives they would do the better thing and provide a reeducation process. </p>
<p class='left'>The strategy of reeducation included prepping the prisoners with months of malnourishment. It was basic Pavlovian conditioning, where, in preparation for their propaganda lessons on the “Wall Street War”, they’d first starve their guests then reward them for signing documents denouncing the United Nations and Capitalism.</p>
<p class='left'>Because of their standard food, GIs referred to their new homes as Bean Camps.Twice daily they’d get baseball sized cakes of soya bean, whole-kernel corn, millet, and koaliang (unsweet sorghum American farmers feed to cattle.) The cakes amounted to 400 grams of food per day or about 1,600 calories. To give you an idea of 1,600 calories, consider that the overweight President Eisenhower was once put on a bed ridden diet of 1,600 quality calories -- and  lost weight. The American prisoners, however, were given cracked corn cakes that should have been cooked for 24 hours. Anything less would cause diarrhea (which many GIs ultimately died from.) Furthermore, the water they used for cooking and drinking came from contaminated wells. The GIs lacked energy to collect wood for cooking so they usually cooked the corn for one hour.</p>
<p class='left'>Meanwhile, North Korean and Chinese POWs held in South Korean camps gained weight.</p>
<p class='left'>Many US POWs had been captured in December 1950. When numbers increased in February, the diet was reduced to 1,200 calories.  </p>
<p class='left'>In the Fall of 1951, captors, in a meager attempt to improve nutrition, gave the GIs cabbages and told them to put the leaves out to dry on the compound roofs so they’d have greens for the winter. GIs used leaves to spell out P O W in big letters. Of course, that was discovered and stopped. Regardless, on the first snow, they trampled P O W in the snow in the compound yard. POW camps, by Geneva Convention rule, were obligated to put signs on camp roofs to identify locations. When GIs complained to captors, they were told UN forces would bomb the shelters. </p>
<p class='left'>The American GI doctors that were in the camps have documented the mental downturns that resulted from malnourishment and despair. One thing they wrote about was that the POWs often lost the ability to speak. Many could not remember the names of people in their family. </p>

<h2>Armistice</h2>

<p class='left'>General Ridgway did a great job turning around the virtual retreat UN forces had been put on when China entered the war. As the war turned into a grinding stalemate, both sides began talking armistice. Yet the war continued. One of the big issues in armistice talks was that a large percentage of North Koreans POWs held by South Korea and UN forces did not want to be repatriated and return home. After two years of negotiations, Operation Big Switch, as it was called, began. A couple of months before the Big Switch,  CCF POW camps began fattening up their prisoners. They added steamed rice, wheat bread, vegetables, and fatty soup to the standard diet.</p>
<p class='left'>But Ralph was not among the formally released and repatriated POWS. He was in a group of POWs being sent via train to China. Ralph had said that his fellow POWs were thrown “one on top of another” into cattle cars.  He said that several soldiers simply gave up and died in the cattle car. That train was thankfully intercepted by UN Forces and the POWs were rescued.  </p>
<p class='left'>I believe Ralph shared this part of his POW experience to teach that one should never give up. He never shared in the other atrocities he endured. Most of the information I gathered for this chapter was from interviews, articles, and books on Korean POWs.</p>
<p class='left'>Charles Miller related a story which suggests some of the pain Ralph endured as a POW. Miller, Lindquist, and their wives vacationed in Germany together in the mid 1970s. Charles was an avid German historian and wanted to visit the Dachau Nazi concentration camp. He suggested they could skip that portion of the trip or he could go alone. </p>
<p class='left'>Ralph insisted he wanted to visit Dachau. The Dachau camp had been reanimated in the early 1970s. They had the bunk rooms set up exactly as they had been during WWII. The walls include numerous pictures donated by Jewish families. There was an area for shooting prisoners. The two couples began discussing the scenarios. But Ralph hung back. He became very quiet. That was one time Charles Miller had seen Ralph show emotion. Ralph got very melancholy. He seemed to be in an out of body experience. Perhaps feeling the concentration of Jewish and subsequent deaths were too close to what Ralph had experienced. I can only imagine what the Jews went through but Ralph experienced something all too similar. </p>
<p class='left'>Anyway, Ralph Lindquist dealt with some horrendous and appalling conditions. He learned to deal with it, and went on to help others. Sensei joked that he lost the ability to speak as a POW, but, after the hospital got him speaking again, he never stopped talking.</p>

<center>
  <h1>Nichiren Buddhism</h1>
</center>

<img src="../images/ch_3_coi_juzu_3.jpeg" class="center"/>

<h3>Spring 1963</h3>


<i>Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. Nam Myoho Renge Kyo.</i>

<p class='left'>It was 9 AM Sunday morning and four men were chanting as they sat in the samurai kneeling position. They were performing the Buddhist ceremony 0-Shodai-Me -- a ceremony led by a buddhist priest. This group’s priest was clothed in traditional gold and black buddhist robes. It was Ralph Lindquist. O-Sensei Lindquist was holding Nichiren Shu O-Juzu beads  (similar to Catholic Rosary beads) as he worked through its one hundred and eight stones. The attendees were Charles Miller, Jim Brown, and Art Hettinger. All three were Karate students training under Ralph Lindquist at Pennsylvania’s first Isshinryu Karate school.</p>
<p class='left'>How did Ralph Lindquist go from being a Prisoner of War who had lost his ability to speak to become a Nichiren Buddhist priest and Karate instructor?</p>
<p class='left'>When American POWs returned to their Army units, they were placed in rehabilitation centers. Ralph mentioned that the staff was very accommodating. He said that anytime of the day or night -- even 2 AM in the morning -- you could get a staff member to play checkers, ping pong, or just talk. Ralph slowly regained his ability to speak. Some of that speech loss was the result of extreme malnutrition. Much of the speech loss POWs experienced also came from depression.</p>
<p class='left'>Following weeks of convalescing at the repatriation facility, Ralph was given several months of Rest and Recreation (R&R) in Japan. Many of his GI compatriots imbibed in the traditional pastime of saki and women. But Ralph spent his time experiencing everything he could about Japanese religion and martial arts. He attended karate and judo dojos and visited various Buddhist and Shinto temples.</p>
<p class='left'>Upon return to the US, Ralph arranged for entry into Japan’s venerable six hundred year old Minobusan temple. He returned to Japan and attended the Minobusan temple for two years in 1954. He had a Korean roommate that had a similar past. His bunkmate had been a World War II Prisoner of War at a Japanese camp. He had been tortured by his captors and most of his teeth had been knocked out. Ralph’s Koren roommate was of great assistance in Ralph’s learning Japanese and keeping up with the Buddhist studies. In the 1960s Ralph’s Buddhist flatmate visited him several times at Ralph’s home in Camp Hill Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class='left'>Ralph continued his martial arts training even while being an acolyte of the temple. He would leave to attend classes at Gogen Yamaguchi’s Goju-ryu dojo. Yamaguchi was Goju-ryu’s grand master. Goju-ryu, by the way, was one of the styles of which Isshinryu was based. In the 1950s, Gogen’s dojo was Japanese only. But Lindquist was allowed to attend as he was a member of the Minobusan temple and spoke Japanese.</p>

<h2>Nam Myoho Renge Kyo</h2>

<p class='left'>Nam Myoho Renge Kyo was the phrase chanted in the O-Shodai-Me ceremony Ralph and his Buddhist/Karate students were chanting. Shodai is an abbreviated Japanese slang term that means, “chanting Daimoku” where daimoku means “sacred title.” Nam Myoho Renge Kyo means Devotion to the Mystic Law of the Lotus Sutra. For Nichiren Buddhism, that’s almost all you need to know. In my computer programming profession, we call statements like that recursive as it calls back to itself. Myoho means Mystic Law. In Buddhism mystic law is the Dharma, where dharma signifies cosmic law underlying right behavior and social order. Renge refers to the Lotus Sutra, which is the written doctrine of the teachings Siddhartha Gautama, the original “Buddha”, preached two and a half millennium ago. In chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, you are saying: “I believe in the teachings of the Lotus Sutra as a way to understand Myoho, the mystic law.” That said, you will be compelled to study and learn from the Lotus Sutra. </p>
<p class='left'>Siddhartha founded Buddhism two and a half millennia ago in India. His teachings were orally disseminated for four hundred years before they were written.The Hindi word for dialog is sutra. The Lotus Sutra contains Siddhartha’s dialogs. Buddhism moved from India, to Vietnam, Korea, and China. China, by the way, with its Taoism and Confucianism, readily adopted Buddhism. Buddhism moved to Japan around the 5th century. It was readily adopted in Japan as they, for the most part, had no formal religion.</p>
<p class='left'>Nichiren Daishonin was born in 1222. He was a Buddist priest before he was sixteen. He was a devout learner who studied all of the Buddhist Sutras and wrote about them in detail. Japan, at that time, had several scisms of Buddhism. Politics were tightly tied to one of those sects. Nichiren was much like Christianity’s Martin Luther in that he was very outspoken in his beliefs. His main belief was that the most important of the Buddhist Sutras was the Lotus Sutra. He was also compelled to spread his buddhist teachings to common Japanese. He ran into quite a bit of political retribution. There were a half-a-dozen governmentally sanctioned attempts on his life -- all of which failed. Some of the attempts were spine-chilling involving swords and such. In one scenario, however, he was simply left on a rock out in an ocean bay where the tide would certainly drown him. But a fisherman happened by and saved him. In another government sanctioned reprisal, he was exiled to an island. Nichiren simply used that time to meditate, further his understanding of the Lotus Sutra, and continue his writing. </p>
<p class='left'>Today Nichiren Buddhism is one of the most heavily followed Buddhist sects in the world. Nichiren Daishonin created the methodology of focusing Buddhism around the chanting of Nam Myoho Renge Kyo.</p>
<p class='left'>Buddhism is full of numbered lists. One of its mainstay lists is the Noble Eightfold Path. These are: right views. thinking, speech, action, way of life, endeavor, mindfulness, and meditation. The word “right” is typically repeated before each of the eight. By right, they more so mean proper. One thing I like about Buddhism is that it doesn’t tell you what right and proper are. That path varies per person. A big part of Buddhism is learning that your view, your perspective, and, hence, understanding is confused by preconceptions. Right view and thinking can only come from letting go of preconceptions and seeing or hearing clearly with fresh eyes and ears.</p>

<h2>At the Temple</h2>

<p class='left'>One of Ralph’s recollections was that everyone in the temple got up at “O Dark One Hundred” (just before dawn) and bathed naked in a frigid creek. Both men and women. Notwithstanding Indian, Chinese, and Japanese beliefs on a male dominant society, Siddhartha, twenty-five hundred years ago, claimed that anyone can become the Buddha, females included. After their cold bath, the acolytes had to pick up trash and weed the garden. Ralph said they almost never found anything but they still had to carefully look for weeds and trash. Often visitors would spot the naked cleaners but Ralph quipped: “It was cold so they didn’t see anything.” </p>
<p class='left'>It was Ralph’s job to clean the latrines -- a job that included syphoning out both liquid and solids out of a hole in the ground to a bucket for disposal. Ralph was told by one of the priests that he had the best job at the temple and he was lucky to have it. He was lucky because it taught humility. </p>
<p class='left'>Their training included chanting specific sections of the Lotus Sutra. Typically focused on chapters two and sixteen. Chapter two expounds that everyone is able to become a Buddha, and Chapter sixteen is a Sakyamuni Buddha's discourse on how life is eternal. Lead temple priests would lecture on the various sutras. </p>

<h2>PTSD and Buddhist view on suffering</h2>

<p class='left'>Both Ralph and his Korean roommate’s POW experience qualified them for Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD.) In my research of Buddhism, I found several psychiatric presentations that identified Buddhism as a “newly discovered” methodology for treating PTSD. Buddhism speaks quite a bit about suffering. Buddhism’s four Noble truths are all about suffering. </p>
<p class='left'>I’ll bet psychologists researching the management of PTSD through Buddhism would have liked to have interviewed Ralph and his roommate. I’ve read articles on the use of Buddhism to treat trauma where they spoke of car accidents as trauma. I agree. But Ralph's trauma was of killing Chinese soldiers, witnessing his GI comrades being killed, seeing his POW friends being beaten to death or dying of malnutrition or simply giving up. I never saw any hint of PTSD-like behavior in Ralph. His wife, Beverly, did say he would sometimes begin yelling in his sleep and lash out with his fists.</p>
<p class='left'>At Ralph’s funeral, one fellow -- who was probably close to 70 but looked like he could still do one-arm chin ups -- spoke briefly about how Sensei helped him. He was a chopper pilot in Vietnam that had experienced too much. He was almost in tears as he explained that Sensei's guidance helped him immensely.</p>

<h2>Sensei Ralph on Buddhism</h2>

<div class="caption">Sensei in traditional buddhist clothing</div>

<p class='left'>Ralph Lindquist was regularly asked to speak on Buddhism. On one of those occasions, he was asked to open a Karate tournament held in the Crispus Atticks community center in York, Pennsylvania. The tournament director’s name was Ken Newman. I remember that in particular because Newman was given my phone number to get in contact with Ralph Lindquist. I was 15 years old and Sensei Newman picked me up at my house on the drive to attend Ralph Lindquist’s class in Camp Hill. Newman was a pastor and a great man who helped numerous underprivileged kids in York PA through Karate training and ministry. We had a wonderful discussion on the ride up and back to class. </p>
<p class='left'>At the start of the tournament, Ralph came to the front of the gym dressed in traditional Buddhist garb. He spoke for a bit then opened the tournament. Imagine how proud I was: This being in the early 1970s when the TV Series Kung Fu was popular with its ass kicking buddhist priests. And there was my head instructor dressed like Master Kan.</p>
<p class='left'>A few years later, one of the men that regularly traveled with me to Ralph’s Harrisburg dojo was a Muslim. He invited Ralph to speak at a symposium where a Muslim mullah, a Jewish Rabbi, and Ralph, as a Buddhist priest, would all speak about their respective religions. The evening started with a mild disturbance as the women -- Jewish, Christian, Muslim, or otherwise -- were expected to sit in a area segregated for women. Ralph Lindquist’s wife, Beverly, a strong woman by any means, took deference to that imposition and made sure the organizers were aware of it. The Muslim mullan and Jewish Rabbi were fairly eloquent with their somewhat complex discussions. Ralph Lindquist, on the other hand, spoke very simply about his need to teach and the importance of leading. He said one thing that stuck with me. He said every teacher wants their students to be better than them. I remember because my training partner, Jim Kotzman, told me he thought Sensei was referring to me. I hope not because I certainly did not become a better martial artist, mentor, or humanitarian than Ralph Lindquist.</p>
<p class='left'>Sensei Charles Miller attended several of Ralph’s talks on Buddhism. One question often raised was: How is Buddhism different from Christianity? Ralph explained: Christianity believes in death bed absolution, which is similar to painting with oil and, at the end, you paint over the bad parts. Buddhism is like painting a picture with watercolor. You can’t paint over the bad parts as it will bleed through. </p>
<p class='left'>Vito Coviello recounted a story of a buddhist talk Ralph gave in the late 1960s. Ralph gave many lectures at various Pennsylvania universities. At a lecture at Elizabethtown College, Ralph dressed in the traditional buddhist garb. But, after the lecture he changed to his gi and came back to the stage with four of his advanced karate students: Vito Coviello, Jim Clark, Brenda Clark, and Joe Salzinger (I’ll cover these four in detail in a later chapter.) </p>
<p class='left'>None of these students had any idea what was about to transpire. Sensei had Brenda lay her body across Jim and Joe as they were prone on the floor on their hands and knees. Ralph had Vito place a watermelon on Brenda’s stomach. Ralph then sliced that watermelon eight times with a samurai sword. Brenda, by the way, was a teenager at the time. He then placed a smaller melon on Vito’s neck and sliced that melon a few times as well.</p>
<p class='left'>Not done, Sensei had Vito lay across the backs of Joe and Jim. Sensei then placed a concrete block on Vito’s stomach and smashed it with a 16 pound sledge hammer. I’m sure you’ve seen similar demonstrations but, in the late 1960s, this was stuff no one had seen before. At any rate, as one of the dismembered blocks crashed on Joe’s hand. Joe blurted out: “What the fuck was that?” Ralph told Joe softly: “Keep quiet you won’t die.” Still not done, Sensei had his students stand in the Isshinryu seisan front stance with arms in punching position. He then began breaking three quarter inch sticks of wood across their arms, shoulders, backs, and thighs. Joe again exclaimed: “What the fuck is this?” To which Sensei said: “Keep quiet and you will live.” After the demo, Vito took Joe to the hospital for finger repair and a hand cast.</p>
<p class='left'>So don’t think of Ralph Lindquist as the buddhist pacifist Dalai Lama or Master Kan of the Kung Fu TV series.</p>

<h2>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</h2>

<p class='left'>From time to time, before Karate class, I’d mention to Sensei the books I was reading in an effort to broaden myself. For a while I was reading about self-hypnotism and Ralph said he had no belief whatsoever in self-hypnotism. We also spoke about James Clavel’s Shogun. I think Ralph may have been impressed that a sixteen year-old read that 1,300 page tome in three days. I believe that may have contributed to why he agreed to write a letter of recommendation to York College for my early acceptance. </p>
<p class='left'>One evening I mentioned I was reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. It was the first religious or pseudo religious book I had read that Sensei liked. He said it was a good book both on engine maintenance and Buddhism. High praise for an expert mechanic and Buddhist priest.</p>

<p class='left'>Sometimes the Pirsig, the author, almost seems to be making fun of Buddhism. At one point he said:</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>Zen has something to say about boredom. Its main practice of ‘just sitting’ has got to be the world’s most boring activity… You don’t do anything much: not move, not think, not care. What could be more boring? Yet in the very center of this boredom is the very thing Zen Buddhism seeks to teach. What is it? What is it at the very center of boredom that you’re not seeing?</i></li>
</ul>

<p class='left'>But then Pirsig would say things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>The real cycle you’re working on is a cycle called yourself. The machine that appears to be “out there” and the person that appears to be “in here” are not two separate things.</i></li>
      <li><i>The [car] drivers seem to be thinking about where they want to be rather than where they are.</i></li>
</ul>

<p class='left'>I think what Sensei liked about Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was the author's approach. Pirsig spoke in detail about engine maintenance and more generally about philosophy. He was not trying to make a point about Buddhism. Whenever Ralph spoke in a philosophical nature, he never spouted Buddhist phrases using Hindi or Japanese terms -- rather he clearly and concisely expressed a belief or thought. </p>
<p class='left'>I also had a discussion with Sensei about the book: The Empty Mirror. It was a bestseller that was written by an American that attended Zen buddhist temple. Today it is considered to be a contemporary classic. Sensei’s response to The Empty Mirror: “I’m afraid it was an empty book.”</i> </p>

<p class='left'>Ralph rarely spoke about Buddhism but he finished each class with group meditation. I always felt a powerful presence coming off Sensei during this brief meditative period. I remember one night we had our last class in a room at the YMCA where we had trained for a half-dozen years. That room was being converted into a modern machine-based fitness center. Being what I thought was the last to leave, I noticed Ralph in a meditative position in the middle of the dojo. I felt a deep respect for this man that was saying goodbye to years of: <i>“Doing, and the sharing of the doing that is the essence and true value. The karate-do.”</i></p>
<center>
  <h1>Tatsuo and the Ronin</h1>
</center>

<img src="../images/ch 4 Tatso.jpg" class='center'/>


<p class='left'>Karate’s origins are from China. Bodhidharma was a buddhist monk who was having issues with students falling asleep during meditation and who were also regularly besieged by highwaymen. Bodhidharma created choreographed routines of kung-fu self-defense exercises that we now call Kata. Kung Fu migrated to Okinawa in the thirteenth century. Originally, karate meant Kara-chinese, Te-hand, or Chinese Hand. Centuries later the symbol for karate was modified to signify empty hand. </p>
<p class='left'>With centuries of adaptation, the original kung fu style was unrecognizable. Of significant importance to the development of karate in Okinawa was that Japan controlled and occupied Okinawa and forbade Okinawans from owning or using weapons. After 300 years of Japanese occupation, through generations of clandestine training, the Okinawans became quite good at this empty hand fighting thing. </p>
<p class='left'>Many folk wrongly believe Karate came from Japan. Actually Karate migrated from Okinawa to Japan in the early 1900s by Gichin Funakosi. </p>
<p class='left'>One of the foremost champions of Okinawan Karate in the 1930s and 40s was Shimabuku Tatsuo. Shimabuku trained under four of Okinawa’s most well regarded masters: Miyagi, Kyan, Motobu, and Taira. These are four names you are not apt to be familiar with… except for Miyagi. If you ever watched the movie The Karate Kid you know his instructor’s name was Mr. Miyagi. The screenwriters got that name from Okinawan karate history. In fact, the kata the kid did in the movies was seiuchin -- which is from the Goju-ryu system that Miyagi founded.</p>
<p class='left'>Shimabuku was such a renowned fighter and instructor that Japan designated him as the hand-to-hand combat trainer for the Japanese Royal Marines. Shimabuku continued to refine the effectiveness of kata through his real world training of Japanese special forces (and later American marines.)</p>
<p class='left'>In 1956 Shimabuku introduced a new style called Isshinryu. Isshinryu incorporated the best of the various styles Tatsuo had studied and mastered. Shimabuku was religious. He was not a priest, but he was deeply religious. The translation of Isshinryu is: school of one heart one mind. Tatsuo incorporated eight codes that all students of Isshinryu had to memorize.</p>

<ol>
  <li>A person’s heart is the same as Heaven and Earth.</li>
  <li>The Blood circulating is similar to the Moon and the Sun.</li>
  <li>A manner of drinking and spitting is either hard or soft.</li>
  <li>A person’s unbalance is the same as a weight.</li>
  <li>The body should be able to change motion at any time.</li>
  <li>The time to strike is when opportunity presents itself.</li>
  <li>The eye must see in every ways.</li>
  <li>The ear must listen in all directions.</li>
</ol>


<p class='left'>I believe these eight codes are arguably similar to Buddhism's Eightfold Path. Regardless, with study and consideration, the Isshinryu code defines a good strategy for life. Ralph Lindquist, although a Buddhist priest, required his students to learn the Isshinryu code but rarely spoke of the eightfold path (which was obviously near and dear to his religious belief.)</p>


<p class='left'>After hundreds of years of Japanese occupation, post world war two, Okinawa was occupied by American forces. In 1957 Shimabuku began training a small number of American Marines. The first were Don Nagle, Harold Long, Richard Keith, and Harry Smith. One part of Tatsuo’s innovative training was that he’d have his students fight full contact as they wore Kendo armour. Richard Keith and Harry Smith trained together at Tatsuo’s Okinawan school for almost two years.</p>
<h2>Harry Smith: Ronin</h2>
<p class='left'>Tatsuo spoke almost no English and he called Harry Smith “Ronin.” He couldn’t have been more accurate with that name. Ronin means a wandering samurai that has no master. </p>


<p class='left'>For decades, Harry Smith performed covert operations for the federal government. This began when Harry, as a young man, chased down a hit and run driver. He ran him off the road, subdued him, stuffed him into his trunk, and drove to the local police office. When police asked if he could identify the driver, Harry showed them the contents of his trunk. Word got out to the military who talked Harry into entering the marines and then asked him to work undercover to expose suspected illicit activities of a military training officer. Harry ended up loving the marines. But this covert relationship with the federal government went on for decades. He was involved with, among other things, the Bay of Pigs. Harry also, for several years, was a mercenary working for the famous Mad Mike Hoare (known as the Wild Geese) in Africa.</p>


<p class='left'>Harry was regularly thrown in jail. It was his practice, when incarcerated, to start a fight -- just to get put in solitary confinement. He confided to Ralph Lindquist that he wanted to be in solitary because he was afraid he might otherwise kill someone. </p>


<p class='left'>At one point Harry Smith told one of his students, George Dilman: “If you ever get into trouble, rob a bank so you go to a federal prison. Then I can get you out.” Ralph Lindquist told me that Harry experienced scenarios where he’d be in a local prison then he’d do something to get transferred to a federal institution. Next, he’d be out of the country for months (doing we don’t know what) and he’d come back a free citizen. In one scenario Harry was incarcerated for putting six cops in the hospital. In another, a man pulled a gun on him in a bar. Without a thought, Harry punched him in the jaw, killing him instantly.</p>


<p class='left'>It is my belief that these early Isshinryu sensei (Long, Nagle, Keith, and Smith) gleaned the very best Tatsuo had to offer. They trained under Tatsuo just as the Isshinryu style was introduced and before it was taken over by Tatsuo’s family.</p>

<center>
  <h1>Do and See; See and Do</h1>
</center>

<center>
  <img src="../images/ch 5 ralph gi young kneeling.jpg" style="width: 50%"> </img>
</center>

<p class='left'>A few months after Harry Smith finished his tour in Okinawa, he ran into Richard Keith at the Harrisburg Marine recruit station. They decided to reinvigorate their Isshinryu skills by opening a dojo. They placed a newspaper ad asking for men to bring fifty dollars to the YMCA to pay for their first month’s instruction. Curiously, after their first class, the YMCA told them they would need to find other facilities. I can only imagine what shenanigans went on to cause the YMCA to ask Smith and Keith not to return. Especially when I consider that these were two hardcore marines had undergone some of the most rigourous martial arts training in the world. </p>
<p class='left'>The first student to enter their class was Ralph Lindquist. Training by hardcore marines was not an issue to this special forces Korean war hero. Initially the class swelled to one hundred but Smith and Keith quickly pared it down to a couple dozen hearty souls. Most were men, many of which were career military or law enforcement. </p>
<p class='left'>The school moved to the basement of Harry’s house that Lindquist and Smith fixed up. Right from the start, Ralph handled the monies and otherwise managed the school. Ralph managed the tournaments, including Pennsylvania’s first Karate tournament in Pittsburg in 1964.</p>

<h2>Class Temperament</h2>

<p class='left'>Every dojo has a particular temperament: an attitude and a feel. Harry Smith’s class was two to three hours long. Most Karate classes today are an hour -- even at that they often stop short at 50 minutes. For Harry’s class, visualize marine basic training combined with practicing punches and kicks to one another. Harry Smith was a big believer in sparring whereas RIchard Keith was a strong advocate of kata. </p>
<p class='left'>George Dillman (one of Harry’s original students) told me, everyone was afraid of sparing Harry -- with the notable exception of Ralph Lindquist. Dillman said the Ralph/Harry sparring sessions were battles. Another original Smith student was George Iberl. Iberl was a big man yet he received several sets of broken ribs from Smith. Now image five foot two inch Ralph sparring regularly with the six foot sadist Smith. Dillman told me that everyone was also afraid of sparring Ralph.</p>
<p class='left'>Quick side story: In the late 70s, after a class, I came bounding down the locker room stairs. A very athletic looking man looked at me, leaped into a stance and said: “Oh. Black Belt. Let’s fight.” I waved him off. My black belt training partner, Dave Bretz, followed me and the man gave him the same challenge. Then the fifty-some Ralph Lindquist followed. The man did his leap to a stance and again and repeated his challenge: “Ah, Black Belt. Let’s fight.” Ralph got in a fighting stance. After a few moments Ralph opened his hands and said: “I’m ready.” The man waved his hands and said: “Oh, I’m just kidding.” I’m not sure if that man realized how much hurt and pain he was extremely close to experiencing. </p>
<p class='left'>At one point another karate school visited the Smith dojo. George Dillman had to spar a large muscular man. The guy wiped the floor with George. He was kicking him all over the dojo with big heavy kicks. After class, Smith grabbed Dillman and said: “My students do not back up!” He told George that the school was coming back in a few weeks and he’d be sparring the same man again. Furthermore, if Dillman did not best the man, Dillman would have to spar him. As I said, everyone was afraid of sparing Smith. Dillman had his friend and personal instructor, Ralph Lindquist, show him how to crowd kicks. The big fellow returned and Dillman destroyed him. Dillman went on to be a national fighting champion and an internationally known martial artist.</p>
<p class='left'>Ralph had a silly quirk in his otherwise seriousness about Karate training. When he would spot Harry out of the context of class, and, when Harry was unaware of Ralph’s presence, Ralph would attack him with punches and kicks. Ralph told me that he’d be crossing the street in downtown Harrisburg dressed in a suit, see Harry, attack him and a brief battle would ensue. Then they’d straighten out their clothes and, without a word, go about their way. Harry said Ralph was a precursor to Inspector Jacques Clouseau’s Cato Fong of Peter Sellers’ Pink Panther movies. It was Cato’s job to attack Inspector Clouseau at unexpected times. The first film in that series came out in 1963, a few years after Ralph’s random attacks on Harry. </p>
<p class='left'>After one class, Harry, Ralph, George, and a few others went to a bar owned by Shoes, one of Harry’s students. Ralph did not drink but the others were enjoying a few draft beers. Anyway, Shoes asked Ralph and Harry to prevent a fight between two guys that were in a heated argument at another section of the bar. Harry and Ralph approached the two. Ralph, undoubtedly, was prepared to reason with the antagonists. But Harry employed a somewhat more brusque approach and simply knocked both of them out. </p>
<p class='left'>At one Saturday class, Harry took his students on a field trip to a local  farm. There Harry confronted a bull and knocked it out with a punch. There are several well known stories of famous karateka killing bulls and I guess Harry wanted to give it a try. This bull, however, sprang right back up after stumbling from the punch. </p>
<p class='left'>Ralph told me a story about a tournament held in a high school gymnasium. The tournament’s Grand Champion wanted to test himself against the great Harry Smith. He pushed and pushed so finally they relented and agreed to have a sparring session at a somewhat closed off area on the school’s stage. Ralph told me Harry was scared about the match. In Harry Smith’s book, Striped Moons, Harry said he was always petrified before any competition or military exercise. Fear stimulates the adrenal glands and Harry admits to being addicted to adrenaline. Why that guy had to fight Harry, I don’t know. They squared off and bowed to each other. But, just as his opponent was raising from the bow, Harry kicked him, leaped on top of him, and began pummeling him and had to be pulled off the grand champion.         .</p>
<p class='left'>There were no paper tigers in Harry Smith’s class. Many of today’s self proclaimed Karate experts couldn’t punch their way out of a paper bag. Harry’s students were all notable. Many went on to serve in the military or police force. A dozen or so opened up their own schools and gained international notoriety.   </p>

<h2>George Dillman</h2>

<img src="../images/ch 5 george george ralph.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">George Iberl, George Dillman, and Ralph Lindquist</div>

<p class='left'>When Dillman started training under Harry, Lindquist took him under his wing. Ralph was a Green belt at that point. Lindquist told Dillman that he had a higher rank from other dojos he attended in Japan but he dropped back to white belt when he started under Harry. When Ralph was attending the Buddhist temple in Japan, he was also frequenting Gogen Yamaguchi’s dojo. Gogen was the grand master of Gojo-ryu (one of the styles Isshinryu was based on.) </p>
<p class='left'>When Dillman reached green belt, Ralph was a brown belt. When Ralph made black belt, Dillman was a brown belt. Ralph used to pick Dillman up at his home for Saturday morning classes. Sometimes George would be hung over and would complain: “I’m sick, I can’t go to class  today.” Ralph would respond: “You can be sick at class.” And he’d drag him off to the dojo. </p>
<p class='left'>When Dillman was a brown belt he opened his own school at the New Cumberland Army depot. Ralph would often visit and help teach. At one point, Dillman took a dozen or so of his students to one of the famous Robert Trias tournaments. Trias confronted Dillman, admonishing him for having his own school yet competing as a brown belt. He told Dillman that he should compete as a black belt. Furthermore, if Dillman did well, Trias would formally award him a black belt. Dillman performed exemplary and Trias promoted him.</p>
<p class='left'>When Ralph found out about Dillman’s advancement he told him: “I’ve tested you for all your previous rank. You aren’t a black belt until I test you.” He arranged for Dillman to come to his school in Camp Hill. When Dillman showed up, Ralph went to the front door and locked it. Dillman asked him: “Is that so no one will come in?” Ralph said: “No. That’s so you don’t leave.” Now, this sounds a bit like the lyrics from Kenny Roger’s Coward of the County: “But you could've heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and locked the door.” But that song did not come out until 1979 and this was in the sixties, and Ralph was a bit tougher than Tommy.</p>
<p class='left'>Ralph had Dillman perform a number of the Isshinryu kata and then they began to spar. They spared “rough” for two hours.  When they finally stopped, their gis were sopping wet. Ralph congratulated him saying: “Now you are a black belt.”</p>
<p class='left'>Dillman became one of the winningest black belts in the country. He became close friends with Bruce Lee and Mohammed Ali and is covered in biographies of both men. His annual East Coast championship was one of the biggest  tournaments in the country. On my twenty-first birthday, I competed in one of Dillman’s tournaments. Ralph Lindquist attended. At that point I had no idea the great George Dillman was a Ralph Lindquist underbelt so I was amazed when Dillman spent every spare moment speaking with Ralph. Dillman told me recently: “I loved Ralph like a brother.”</p>

<h2>George Iberl</h2>

<p class='left'>Another internationally known Isshinryu sensei is George Iberl. George met Ralph Lindquist by chance at a retail store and their shared interest in martial arts came up in conversation. Ralph invited Iberl to visit his home for introductory instructions on Isshinryu. Iberl trained at Ralph’s backyard dojo many times. George wanted to attend Harry Smith’s school but, having recently emigrated from Germany, he wanted to improve his English before attending group classes. One feature of the Lindquist home dojo was makiwara striking post training. Iberl continued extensive makiwara training for decades. In the seventies, a friend of mine dated Iberl’s niece. When he went to pick her up at Iberl’s house, he heard the whack, whack, whack of Iberl’s makawari strikes. Then George came out to introduce himself, with his deep German accent,  as the uncle of the teenage girl my friend was about to take on a date.</p>
<p class='left'>Iberl trained under Smith and Lindquist until he was a brown belt. He credits Lindquist with teaching him most of the Isshinryu kata. Iberl moved to DC for a time and when Angi Uezu (Tatsuo’s son-in-law) visited the US, Iberl convinced him to stay at his home for several months. It was from Angi that Iberl received his black belt. Iberl continued to study under Angi for many years and achieved high rank. He opened karate schools in Gettysburg and York Pennsylvania. He ran dozens and dozens of tournaments over the course of many decades. I competed in many of them myself. Iberl attended Ralph’s funeral in 2015 and passed away himself in 2020.</p>

<h2>Fierce Competitor</h2>

<img src="../images/ch 5 ralph 1st bb fighting dillman tourney.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Lindquist (far right) first place in black belt fighting at a George Dillman tournament</div>

<p class='left'>Ralph Lindquist was a regular competitor in Karate tournaments. Dillman often travelled and competed with Lindquist. In the early 1960s, when tournaments were rather irregular, karateka traveled from all over the country to compete. Often competitors had dozens of elimination bouts before making it to the finals. Despite Ralph’s short stature, he most always made it to the finals and often won his division. I was lucky to find a YouTube video of one of those early tournaments and it contained a short clip with Ralph fighting. He fought exactly as I was told he fought -- always attacking on 45 degree angles as he constantly circled his opponent. He never backed up. In that one match he did, at one point, throw a lunging  punch where he whacked his opponent and ended up behind him.</p>
<p class='left'>Ralph competed at Canada’s first karate tournament in 1963. It was hosted by Masami Tsuruoka (who is recognized as the father of Canadian karate.) Ralph competed in the Black Belt division despite still being a brown belt. The day after the tournament, Harry had Ralph test for his black belt in front of Tsuruoka. He was promoted on the spot. Tsuruoka and Lindquist became good friends. Ralph continued to attend Masami yearly Canadian tournaments and Tsuruoka would travel to Harrisbug for several of the tournaments Lindquist arranged and promoted.</p>
<p class='left'>One competition story Ralph told me was that he was fighting a huge man. You’d think the crowd would support the little guy but, seeing Ralph’s prior bouts, they were shouting “Kill him, Kill him” to their six foot two inch underdog friend. I’m not sure the jeers helped as Ralph remembers splitting the guys cup in half with a front kick.</p>
<p class='left'>Charles Miller told me of Ralph’s sparring skills: “He was a ghost, he was never where he should have been when you fought him.”</p>
<p class='left'>One Ralph technique that I remember in particular was a reverse punch / back kick. He’d power in with his devastating reverse punch and, on the retraction, he’d do what he called “a hip switch” and nail you with a pile driver back kick. If you were lucky enough to block the reverse punch you were never ready for the back kick that came a quarter second later -- and at an unstoppable angle.</p>
<p class='left'>Ralph competed all over the east coast and Canada. He also regularly competed in the Robert Trias tournaments in Chicago. He had numerous trophies which he eventually donated or disposed of. </p>

<div class="caption">Sensei Lindquist, with a samurai sword, slicing a potatoe on the stomach of a teenage female student</div>


<h2>The Pittsburgh School</h2>

<p class='left'>In 1962 Harry Smith moved to Pittsburgh and opened a new school. At that point Ralph Lindquist formally took full control of the Harrisburg school. Nevertheless, Ralph regularly drove to Pittsburgh to continue training with Harry Smith. He also provided personal training to many of the Pittsburgh students. Harry Aklin, for example, started under Harry in Pittsburgh and went on to have a string of successful dojos in Ohio. Besides regularly visiting the Pittsburg dojo, Ralph would often meet Aklin at a rest stop halfway between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh to train Aklin in kata. </p>
<p class='left'>In 1966 Shimabuku Tatsuo visited the Pittsburgh dojo for several months. Ralph attended many of the training sessions. The club filmed Tatsuo performing all the Isshinryu kata. Ralph had copies of those 8mm files. At times he’d review the film for a last word on movement in Kata. Those 1966 videos are now famous and readily available on Youtube.  </p>
<p class='left'>Note that Dick Keith, who started the Harrisburg Isshinryu dojo with Harry Smith, after another session of training on Okinawa with Tatsuo in the early 1960s, stopped formal training and dedicated his life to the military.</p>

<h2>Notable Students</h2>

<p class='left'>The greatness of Ralph Lindquist was more than his fighting and kata skills: it was his mentoring. Ralph trained numerous notable students. Perhaps my favorite Lindquist saying was: “Do and see; see and do.” Ralph felt strongly about teaching and the concept of: “To teach is to learn twice.” In this chapter I’m going to cover a few of the students Ralph trained in the 1960s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jim Brown</li>
  <li>Jim Clark</li>
  <li>Brenda Clark</li>
  <li>George Dillman</li>
  <li>Art Hettinger</li>
  <li>George Iberl</li>
  <li>Ron Lawrence</li>
  <li>Charles Miller</li>
  <li>Jake Stoss</li>
  <li>Ted Vollrath</li>
</ul>


<p class='left'>When I was 15 years old (in 1974) my parents dropped me off at a tournament at the Harrisburg Area Community College (HACC.) I didn’t know what I was doing and I was alone. No one from Lindquist’s York or Harrisburg dojos attended. That day I saw two karateka I’d never forget: Ted Volrath and Jake Stoss. </p>
<p class='left'>Karate tournaments always begin with Black Belt kata. I saw some great kata, although some were new to me as they were Kung Fu. But, during the weapons competition, I saw one karate kata I’d never forget. This small man popped up in front of the senior black belt judges carrying his bo staff like it was a part of him. He oozed with confidence. After bowing deeply and slowly, he suddenly burst into action. His bo staff whizzed around him like helicopter blades. I recognized that kata. It was Isshinryu’s standard bo kata. </p>
<p class='left'>I didn’t find out till a decade later that the karateka was Jake Stoss. He was taught kata by none other than Ralph Lindquist. Jake was persuaded to start Karate training by Jim Clark when Jim was training undler Ralph Lindquist. Jim and Jake later ended up opening their own Karate school.</p>
<p class='left'>The other unforgettable man I met at that HACC tournament was Ted Vollrath. Ted was a student of Jake Stoss and Jim Clark. He had no legs. He performed an amazing demonstration that day. First, his wheelchair had arms that, when pulled, lifted out with knives. Us unarmed combat efficianados might consider knives cheating but Ted, kniveless, would leap out of that chair, grab the gi of an assailant with one hand, pull himself up to head level, and whack the crap out of him with his other fist. His arms were massive. When on the ground Ted would scramble around doing vicious take downs and pulling himself between legs. He was pretty much unstoppable at his vantage point on the ground. Later that day, I bought a pair of nunchucku from Mr. Volrath, who had a weapons stand at the tournament. </p>

<div class="caption">Lindquist and Volrath with Patty and Jack Lipsett</div>

<p class='left'>Chuck Norris in his book “The Secret Power Within: Zen Solutions to Real Problems” wrote about Ted Vollrath. Ted was injured in the Korean war when a mortar shell shredded his legs. The legs had to be amputated. Vollrath wanted to learn karate but several instructors told him it was impossible and refused to take him as a student. Eventually Vollrath visited Jim Clark’s school. Jim took Vollrath to visit his esteemed instructor, Ralph Lindquist. Ralph asked to sit in Ted’s wheelchair. Ralph meditated while sitting in the chair for some time. As Norris quoted Ralph in his book, Ralph opened his eyes and said: “If you want it, it’s there. But you must want it badly.” Ted did want it badly and mastered martial arts. Eventually he starred in the Hollywood movie “Mr. No Legs.”</p>
<p class='left'>Jim Clark was an amazing martial artist. He had the fastest hands I’ve ever seen. He traveled to numerous tournaments with Jake Stoss and they always left with multiple trophies. Jim Clark was a police officer for Swatara Township, Pennsylvania. He once took out a gang of five. The story, as he tells it, was that he quickly dispatched the leader and his two closest henchmen.The remaining two (seeing the devastation caused by Clark’s blinding hand speed and powerful kicks) decided to revoke their gang responsibilities and quickly ran away.</p>
<p class='left'>Jimmy Carter gave Jim Clark and Jake Stoss a Presidential award for their effective hand to hand combat training they gave to numerous young military men before they were sent to fight Vietnam. </p>
<p class='left'>I can’t write about Jim Clark without mentioning Brenda Clark. Brenda was Jim’s niece. She was an athlete and began training under Ralph when she was 13. She was a tenacious student and acquired her black belt in 4 years. She was the only female student to receive a black belt from Lindquist. Brenda was a standout athlete in college. After college she became a Lower Paxton patrol cop, made detective, did DEA undercover work in Pittsburg, and eventually became a Federal Marshall. Interestingly, Brenda became one of the country's best polygraph testers. She was listed by the FBI as one of their top three polygraph testers. </p>

<h2>Charles Miller</h2>

<img src="../images/ch 5 miller kumite tournament.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Sensei Miller competing in kumite</div>

<p class='left'>Charles Miller is a Ralph Lindquist student of particular note to me as he was my first karate instructor. </p>
<p class='left'>Charles had interest in karate and took Tae Kwon Do lessons for a time while he was in the Air Force. Charles was an accomplished drummer and was a member of the prestigious Air Force Drum and Bugle corps. After leaving the military, Charles, by chance, discovered Ralph’s Isshinryu school in Camp Hill Pennsylvania. At his first lesson, Ralph showed Charles one punch. Miller practised that punch for several classes before Ralph showed him a front kick. Charles worked on the reverse punch front kick for several weeks before he was allowed to join the regular class and begin learning kata. </p>
<p class='left'>Ralph Lindquist had an affinity for interesting people. Charles Miller is interesting. He was a Senior Engineer at AMP Incorporated, a world leader in electrical and electronic connection devices and interconnection systems. As of 2020, Miller has been a member of the Glen Rock Carolers for sixty-four years. For the past 170 years, the carolers have dressed in Dickenson garb with top hats and frock coats and walk the streets of Glen Rock Pennsylvania caroling. Charles is also an avid student of German history. In the 1970s he became interested in the rustic style of Southern Bavarian German dancing, known as shoe slapping. He procured the proper training and began a dance team. When Ralph first saw Miller’s shoe slapping dance group he said: “That’s Kata.” I saw Miller’s group perform several times myself and I was awestruck. </p>
<p class='left'>One of Ralph’s teaching strategies that deeply impressed Sensei Miller was that Lindquist started training students to be teachers themselves right from the beginning. When you were an upper belt, you trained the lowerbelts. Sensei Miller was a great instructor. Besides having us do bone-bruising training exercises and techniques, Miller taught us anatomy. He’d bring in a big cork board and he’d detail the bone structure of human anatomy. We listened attentively because we knew we’d receive questions on anatomy when testing for our next belt. Miller also taught us how to properly fold and carry our gis explaining the Okinawan and Japanese philosophy of tidiness. When attending tournaments, I felt an odd feeling of superiority as my gi was properly folded and wrapped into a neat tube with my belt tied around it and cooly draped over my shoulder. </p>
<p class='left'>After training under Lindquist in the Camp Hill dojo for a few years, Miller, who lived in York Pennsylvania, started a class in York. One winter Charles was in a severe snowmobile accident. His back was broken and he had a cast from his neck to past his hips. He asked Lindquist to travel to York and take over leading the class. Ralph asked him: “Can you walk?” Charles said: “Yes.”. Ralph responded: “Then you can teach class.” Despite admonishing Miller to teach the class himself, Ralph did come down. He gave Charles personal instruction on movements he could do under the constraints of the cast. But Miller still led the class. Miller credits his karate training for helping him recover in less than half the time predicted by doctors.</p>
<p class='left'>Ralph and Charles became great friends. As I cover in detail in the next chapter, Ralph was Charles’s best man for his wedding.</p>

<h2>Art Hettinger</h2>
<p class='left'>Art was another Lindquist black belt of note. Not only did he advance in rank and was a good instructor himself, his family was close with Ralph’s. Ralph was Art's best man at his wedding and Art's kids were like grandchildren to Ralph and Beverly. In fact, Art’s kids called Ralph and Beverly Grandpa and Grandma. Ralph never had children but he loved kids. Every year Lindquist wrote a huge check to the Cub Scouts of America. </p>

<h2>Jim Brown</h2>
<p class='left'>Jim Brown was an early student of Ralph’s. Jim became an adurent student of Buddhism as well as Isshinryu. Ralph loved Jim. Jim had been a national level golden gloves champion. Once he mastered Karate he was all but unstoppable at tournaments. Unbeknownst to everyone but Ralph, Jim had a dependency on hard drugs. All too early in his life he overdosed.  </p>

<h2>Ron Lawrence</h2>

<p class='left'>I had heard about the famous Ron Lawrence for several years before I met him. In the late 1970s and early 1980s Ron began, somewhat regularly, traveling from his home in New Jersey to, once again, attend Lindquist’s classes. It was my pleasure to work out with that legend. I call him a legend because he was a Ralph Lindquist black belt that spent several years training in Japan and eventually won a prestigious national level tournament.</p>
<p class='left'>Ron began training with Ralph in 1967. In researching for this book I discovered multiple issues of Black Belt magazine listing Ron as tournament winner. In a 1969 issue he won green belt kata, weapons, and fighting at a huge tournament. Then in 1970 he won kata, weapons, and fighting in the brown belt division. Then, later that same year, he was grand champion of several large tournaments. Grand Champion is a black belt that won in all three divisions: fighting, kata, and weapons. I’ve taken first place in black belt kata and weapons on several occasions but I never took the whole thing by winning first in fighting as well. </p>
<p class='left'>Ron was a black man. He had a masters degree in math from Howard university. One story Ralph told about Ron was that they were at a tournament and the judges were refusing to call points when Ron was blasting his opponent with punches to the ribs. The judges obviously wanted their white champion to win. Despite not calling points for Ron’s punches, they had to stop the match several times so Ron’s poor opponent could recover from the punches no one, apparently, saw. Ralph matter of factly told them, he’s going to continue punching right through him unless you start calling points.</p>

<div class="caption">Ron Lawrence (far left) Grand Champion Black Belt Kata and Kumite</div>


<p class='left'>Ron’s first wife was a big proponent of the Black Panthers. Ron began to become more involved with that organization. At one point things were becoming too serious and Ralph walked into one of the Black Panther meetings and pulled Ron out to speak with him. Can you imagine a five foot two inch blond man walking into a Black Panther meeting? I’m not sure if the complexities with the Black Panther society were a cause, but in the early 1970s Ron divorced his wife, quit his high paying job as an IBM mainframe salesman, and moved to Japan.   </p>
<p class='left'>One last story about Ron. He had a brown belt student Hank Hamiltion that he’d sometimes bring to class. This “little” guy had been an NFL lineman for several years. Yeah, he was big. But he was extremely soft spoken and gentle. His movements were typically slow. He really enjoyed karate training. He once attended a tournament that we both competed in. I was in the green belt division and he was in the brown belt group. He ends up being matched up against another huge man. This guy was so big he had to cut the sleeves off his gi as his arms were too massive. He was overly aggressive and started to bear down hard on our ex-NFL karateka. That’s when I discovered that the biggest NFL linemen are faster and more athletic than I had ever imagined. The serious attack from a man his size woke something in him. It was like he was back on the 5 yard line and he opened up on his big opponent. His kicks were higher than I had ever seen him throw and his punches were blinding fast. His poor opponent did not stand a chance. The cool thing was, our NFL-karateka had subsequent matches with average sized men, and he was back to slow and easy. He lost matches out of kindness and an understanding of what he was capable of doing. </p>
<p class='left'>There were numerous other Ralph Lindquist black belts from the sixties that I have not elaborated on. These include Clyde Rando, Bob Rathfon, Doc Howell, Jake Stone, and Bill Moore. </p>
<p class='left'>Industry Luminaries</p>
<p class='left'>In researching this book I read or was otherwise orally recounted stories about Ralph’s relationship with many Karate luminaries. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Danny Pai</li>
  <li>Ed Parker</li>
  <li>Jhoon Rhee</li>
  <li>Robert Trias</li>
  <li>George Dillman</li>
  <li>George Iberl</li>
  <li>Steve Armstrong</li>
  <li>Don Nagle</li>
  <li>Harold Long</li>
</ul>

<h2>Jake Stoss, Jim Clark, Brenda Clark, and Ted Vollrath</h2>

<p class='left'>I found or was given numerous photos with Ralph working alongside these guys in some of the earliest Karate tournaments in the country. All of these men worked hard to develop names (highly googleable) for themselves and most had full careers as internationally known and respected Karate sensei.</p>

<img src="../images/ch 5 trias bohan pai ralph.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Robert Trias, Don Bohan, Danny Pai, and Ralph Lindquist</div>

<p class='left'>Danny Pai was probably the closest to Ralph of the other luminaries listed. Danny came from an asian martial arts family. He was the grandmaster of Pai Lum Kung Fu. I knew several martial artists that studied Pai Lum Kung Fu. One of those Pai Lum students told me a story of seeing Danny Pai give a demonstration where he would catch a sword being slashed at him between the two palms of his hand.</p>
<p class='left'>Ralph and Danny often travelled together to tournaments. Ralph recounted a story to me where he and Danny drove to a New York city tournament in one of Ralph’s Rolls Royces. On one of New York streets a car full of young troublemakers were harassing Ralph and Danny with a bit of road rage. Danny told Ralph he had a plan. If the car cut them off, they’d both jump out and go to either side of the other car and pick them off as they come out. Ralph laughed as he told me this story and said to me: “I had my own plan. My plan was to drive off after Danny jumped out of the car.” Which is pretty funny considering Ralph would never do that and Danny (or Ralph) could have handled the whole group themselves anyway.</p>
<p class='left'>In another Danny Pai story, Ralph and Danny went to a Chinese restaurant after a tournament. They ate a hearty meal but, when the overly exorbitant check came, they realized they didn’t have enough money. They got into a discussion with management and eventually a man came out with a meat cleaver. Ralph and Danny decided to escape and ran out of the restaurant and down the street laughing crazily. </p>
<p class='left'>Danny Pai was once talking about advanced belt ranks and how to manage the overproliferation of rapidly advancing black belts. He suggested that for shodan (first degree) you cut off one finger. For nidan, you cut off a second finger. Ralph was among the group of industry luminaries Danny was speaking to. Ralph had put his arms behind his back, balled his fists up, and pulled them hidden up his gi sleeves. When Danny finished his discourse, Ralph held up his handless arms and said: “Meet your master Sensei Pai!” </p>
<p class='left'>Ed Parker was a cousin of Danny Pai. Ed collaborated with Ralph on many of the early east coast tournaments. Ed Parker had a notable career as a Hollywood choreographer and personal trainer for Elvis Presley. He was also the leader of American Kempo Karate.</p>
<p class='left'>Jhoon Rhee is recognized as the father of American Taekwondo. Jhoon Rhee was always amazingly fit. At seventy years old he would start his classes with 100 pushups. Starting in the early 1960s, Rhee had numerous tournaments in Washington DC. They were attended by karateka from across the country. Rhee was good friends with Bruce Lee, who often performed demonstrations at Jhoon’s tournaments. Jhoon got along great with Ralph. They were both avid gardeners and did their own lawn care.You could always tell when Ralph push-mowed his one acre lawn barefoot as he’d come to class with green feet. Rhee told Ralph a story about when he was working on his lawn in a prestigious Washington DC neighborhood. He was wearing traditional gardener clothes. A man drives by in a Mercedes and stops. He questions this asian lawn care worker about his gardening skills as he compliments him. Then he asked Jhoon how much the owner pays him for his work. Jhoon, with a straight face, told him: “He lets me sleep with his wife.”  </p>
<p class='left'>Steve Armstrong, Don Nagle, and Harold Long were among the first Americans to train under Shimabuku Tatsuo. All were military and each had great respect for Ralph Lindquist. Armstrong, Nagle, and Long regularly hosted and attended tournaments where they collaborated with Lindquist. Whenever possible, Ralph shored up his Isshinryu knowledge by training with these three men.</p>
<p class='left'>The amazing thing about these martial arts luminaries is that Ralph existed as kind of a quiet phantom. He was a powerful figure in American martial arts fitting right in as he stood beside these other famous individuals. But Ralph Lindquist never looked for notoriety.</p>

  <h1>A Lindquist Workout in the 70s</h1>
</center>

<p class='left'>A weightlifter friend heard I drove a half-hour from York to Harrisburg several times a week to train under Ralph Lindquist. He was flabbergasted. He asked me: <i>“With someone like Gary Brooks right here in York, why would you drive all that way to Harrisburg.”</i> I didn’t directly answer his question, opting not to tell him the Ralph Lindquist’s story. This guy didn’t know it, but I had trained under Gary Brooks. I had been going to Gary’s dojo on Eberts lane for most Saturdays from when I was between fourteen and fifteen years old. I continued to train with Brooks black belt students for years. Brooks was Shotokan and I had also trained under some of York’s best Tae Kwon Do instructors (Ed Costigan, Bill Sprenkle, and Ed Schmidt) when I was between sixteen and nineteen. Ralph Lindquist was cut from a different cloth than these instructors. They taught me how to kick, punch, and fight. Ralph taught me how to be a man -- as well as how to be a standout martial artist. Note that Ralph asked Gary Brooks to be on my black belt test board. Gary was a big man who loved to drink beer after karate class and enjoyed a good bar fight. Those fights took their toll as, among other ailments, he eventually lost his spleen. Yes, I did learn about fighting from Gary Brooks but I went to Lindquist’s dojo in Harrisburg to learn karatedo -- the way of karate -- from a  true master.</p>
<p class='left'>I was, for the most part, a kid back 1975 when I’d drive my Ford Falcon from York PA to Harrisburg once or twice a week for class. I was sixteen, in eleventh grade, and considered Karate my sport. This chapter is a recount of one of those classes.</p>
<p class='left'>The class was in a bar. Well, it was a failed bar that Lindquist bought, gutted, and lined it with mirrors and indoor/outdoor carpeting, and created an unforgettable karate dojo. Undoubtedly, as with most USA karate pioneers, Lindquist patterned classes after his own combat training. </p>
<p class='left'>I arrived at class early and there was a lot of chatter. But soon everyone got quiet as we realized sensei was sitting — Buddhist style — on his insteps in a meditative position. We each ran to a spot and knelt down. After everything was perfectly silent for a moment or so, Ralph clapped his hands and leapt to his feet in the sei-san front stance. We did the same (although some of us with the aid of our hands.) He put his feet together and bowed — which we all did, only we bowed much more deeply showing respect. (It would have been interesting to see what might have happened if someone had not have returned the bow!)</p>
<p class='left'>As always, Ralph began class with karate’s mainstay exercise of knuckle pushups. He did probably forty and we knew we’d do another three or four sets of forty or so before class was over. At that point a life-worn man in his late forties appeared in the door, took off his shoes and joined the group for his first karate class.</p>
<p class='left'>Sensei then led us through side to side squats -- -- for leg strength and side kick flexibility. And then some squats on the balls of your feet. These “toe benders” were used to train those stubby things to get out of the way during front kicks and lessen the chance of breaking toes.</p>
<p class='left'>Sensei then dropped down on his back and led us through leg lifts — for abdominal strength. He popped up and ran around the class bouncing on top of various student’s abs. You learned to exhale! For brown belts, of which I was one,  Ralph would stop, bend down, and deliver a few sharp punches to our bellies. You had the option of grunting or a Kiai (verbal shout of spirit from the belly) on each strike.</p>
<p class='left'>Several times during the exercises the karate neophyte rushed outside to throw up. Sensei urged him to sit it out but the man said <i>“No. I need to do this.”</i> I became good friends with him in later years. He was A. J. Boyd, a hard working, ex-military, electrician for the Pennsylvania railroad. He was a functioning alcoholic that became sober through karate training. A dozen or so years later, A.J. earned his black belt.</p>


<img src="../images/ch 6 AJ class.jpg" class="center"</>
<div class="caption">A.J. as a Black Belt in front with Sensei, A.J.s wife Carol, Ron Lawrence, and Art Hettinger behind them</div>

<p class='left'>After finishing a few more typical karate-style calisthenics, Sensei started one person drills. We did basic punches in deep horse stances (till our legs shook with pain.) Next he led us through a variety of kicks from a fighting stance. We usually did ten repetitions. Sensei admonished: <i>“The last three should always be your hardest.”</i> Most of us were getting out of breath and Sensei admonished <i>“Get out the bad air and get in the good air.”</i> Proper breathing was an Okinawan karate standard that Ralph continually pressed.</p>

<h2>Ippon Kumite</h2>

<p class='left'>Sensei asked us to pair up and he demonstrated an ippon kumite (one step sparring) drill. Your partner threw a straight right to your chest and you were to block it and counter with your own right cross. Unfortunately, I somehow ended up with Joe Salzinger for a partner.</p>
<p class='left'>Salzinger had the forearms of Popeye from years of working at a loading dock. His father had been a professional boxer but Joe’d rather train with Sensei Lindquist. Joe was a Pennsylvania state policeman. He later retired after ten years (having qualified for continued health benefits) to become a blacksmith. He quit being a State Trooper mostly because he was so respected by coworkers that, whenever things were getting difficult, they’d put calls out for Joe. One time he arrested a guy with a prosthetic hook for a hand. To be nice, Joe didn’t cuff him, but the first chance this poor guy had he took a hooked swing at Joe. Joe reacted and his training may have saved his life. He later found out that this guy had taken other people out with the same right “hook".</p>
<p class='left'>I was to be the first to throw the offensive punch. I squared off and lobbed a punch that stopped an inch before Joe’s chest. Joe didn’t move. He asked <i>“Why would I block that?”</i> I lobbed another one with a bit more energy and, once again, Joe did nothing but sneer. <i>“Come on!”</i> he said. So I threw a punch that hit him lightly on his chest (which was built up from years of knuckle push-ups.) Joe just looked at me. I deepened my stance and threw one with my full 185 pounds behind it. My punch whacked him hard on the chest and he grunted <i>“That’s it. Do it again.”</i> I threw another, which he blocked and a quarter-second later cracked my own chest pulling the punch just after it smacked me — leaving a red mark and the promise of a bruise.</p>
<p class='left'>When it was my turn to do the counterpunch you can be damn well sure I blocked the hay makers Joe was throwing.</p>

<h2>Floor as a Heavy Bag</h2>

<p class='left'>Uh oh… everyone was going down for push ups. Oddly Sensei was not on his knuckles. He was on his palms in gym class style push ups. He leaned to one side holding himself up with one palmed hand. His other hand was in a fist cocked to the side of his ribs. He torched his body parallel to the floor and cracked the floor with his knuckled fist. I said crack in that I expected the cement floor to split wide open. My own strikes were more akin to tapping someone lightly on their shoulders to get their attention than cracking.</p>
<p class='left'>Years later my son’s friends would speak of me as the wall puncher after they saw me in our basement training by cracking a cement block divider wall with punches.</p>
<p class='left'>Jumping up from the “cement floor as a heavy bag” exercise, Sensei had us group up for Kata training. Belt ranks were based on learning the complex Isshinryu kata along with self defense and fighting skills. Groups of two or three would have one advanced student show others the next kata in their advancement. Sensei was big on kata saying: <i>“kata is fighting”</i>.</p>

<h2>The Flying Punch</h2>

<p class='left'>After about a half hour of kata we grouped for free fighting. Cool. We didn’t free fight that often as Sensei’s philosophy was <i>“train hard; fight easy”</i> A philosophy I discovered years later champion wrestling coaches used by working drills more than open wrestling. At the rough karate tournaments of the seventies Sensei Lindquist’s students always fared extremely well.</p>
<p class='left'>Sensei was feeling spunky as he asked Bill Dolinger to spar. A treat because Sensei, who was around fifty, did not spar that often. Dolinger was a big black belt. He was six foot two and built much like Joe Don Baker of the original Walking Tall. Bill did stand big and tall as Sensei circled him and made odd clucking noises with his tongue (a quirk that those who had spared Sensei over the years warned you about as it meant he was in the zone.) Bill exploded with one of his long powerful front kicks. Sensei took a slight side step and performed a ballerina style dance kick to the floor behind Bill’s back. With a one-eighty pirouette on that dance kick’s toe, Sensei was completely behind Bill. He grabbed the nape of Bill’s gi top, stepped on Bill’s right hip, pulled himself up and began whacking the back of Bill’s head with punches. Watching, to me it looked like Bill didn’t know where Sensei disappeared and he didn’t much like getting whacked behind his head.</p>
<p class='left'>Sensei dropped back to his feet and Bill turned to face his assailant. Bill stood up with his feet together, bowed and said <i>“thank you.”</i> Thank you for showing me a weakness in my defense, that is. Kind of a Zen of Tennis sort of thing.</p>
<p class='left'>Bill dropped back into a fighting stance clearly ready for anything. Only he wasn’t. Sensei leaped off both feet and sailed through the air a bit higher than Bill’s head. Sensei was pretty much in an impenetrable ball. His left elbow was touching his left knee, which was raised up high. Bill put both hands up to block this flying menace. But Sensei’s lead left hand slapped Bill’s lead blocking away as he torched his right hip and knee forward as he delivered a cement floor crackable punch to Bill’s face. As sensei landed back on his feet, Bill had a beaming smile. He was on the receiving end of greatness. He was six foot two fighting a man five-two who was coming down from above on him.</p>
<p class='left'>I’ll tell you. I didn’t see such technique again until the Star Wars movies came out with Yoda’s flying fight sequences.</p>
<p class='left'>I loved that flying punch. I’d train by laying chairs down and repeatedly leap over them and perform the punch. I used it effectively against some of the best local talent in black belt level competition. In the twenty-first century MMA fighters began calling this the superman punch but Ralph Lindquist was doing it in the nineteen-sixties and I used it in the seventies and eighties.</p>

<div class="caption">Sensei performing the flying punch in his 60s</div>

<p class='left'>Just then Dave Bretz tapped my shoulder and asked to spar. Dave was only a green belt but he was a football and wrestling standout that was into bodybuilding. His gis was tight on his arms. He was twenty-two and I was sixteen. But I was a brown belt and my kicks were spot on. I’d watch Bruce Lee movies and drill kicks every night in my parent’s basement. At parties I’d show off by kicking cigarettes out of mouths and hats off heads. I threw some flashy kicks at Dave’s head but he waded inside these flashy nuisances pushing my kicking knee aside with his lead hand while whacking my ribs with a resounding reverse punch. I went home regularly with bruises on my torso and face from this, so called, no contact karate.</p>

<img src="../images/ch 6 vito bretz.jpg" class="center"</>
<div class="caption">Dave Bretz man handled me but here Sensei Coviello is presenting him with a side kick</div>

<h2>Breath</h2>

<p class='left'>Simultaneously, everyone noticed Sensei kneeling in the Samurai position at the front of class. We ran to our original class starting positions and knelt down ourselves. Sensei seemed to be having an out of body experience. He was breathing deep meditative breaths, his hands were in the standard Nichiren budddhist palmed position (like you are holding an egg, Ralph would explain.) After maybe a minute, or two (it's hard to say, after a hard class this mediation period was like sitting in cool shade drinking ice water) Ralph leaped up to seisan stance and bowed and said: <i>“Thank you.”</i> We also bowed responding: <i>“Thank you, Sensei.”</i></p>

<center>
  <h1>Black Belts of the 1970s</h1>
</center>

<p class='left'>The most significant event of Ralph Lindquist’s instruction in the 1970s, from my perspective, was the promotion of four black belts in January of 1974: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Vito Coviello</li>
  <li>Bill Dollinger</li>
  <li>Frank Sciortino</li>
  <li>Dick Rupert</li>
</ul>

<img src="../images/ch 7 4 black belts with certificates.jpg" class="center"</>
<div class="caption">Frank and Dick in Front, Bill and Vito Behind</div>

<p class='left'>Vito was from Mechanicsburg Pennsylvania but the other three were York Pennsylvania-based students of Charles Miller. Those three travelled to Harrisburg to train under Ralph as often as possible. All four men began training in the late 1960s and became exemplary martial artists in the 1970s.</p>
<p class='left'>Also occurring in early seventies was the introduction of Lord Beans, Ralph getting Sensei Miller arrested, and some serious swordplay at The York Little Theater.</p>

<h2>Vito Coviello</h2>

<img src="../images/ch 7 vito talking to ralph.jpg" class="center"</>
<div class="caption">Vito Coviello in a discussion with Sensei</div>

<p class='left'>Vito was a successful architect who appreciated the intellect and gentility of Ralph Lindquist. Vito began training under Ralph in 1968. I started training under Charles Miller in 1973 (when I was 13 years old) but, when I was of driving age, I began travelling to Ralph’s Harrisburg dojo once or twice a week. Typically Ralph would start the class but would then hand it over to Vito, who was an excellent, if demanding, sensei.</p>
<p class='left'>I drove up from York to Lindquist’s Enola school one Saturday so we could attend a tournament as a group. Vito Coviello was there along with three other students. We drew straws to see who would drive. I lost so the five of us climbed into my 1963 Ford Falcon. When we got to the tournament everyone knew Vito. The tourney started with a demo by one of the most fantastic karateka I've ever seen. At one point he had a student sit on the shoulders of another student and hold a board up high. He leaped up and did a spin hook kick in mid air and cracked a board dangling between two fingers. But, for kumite, he had to fight Vito Coviello for 1st place and, super flying hook kicks or not, he didn't crack that barrier. Vito beat him in kata as well.</p>
<p class='left'>I didn't place in my own division, but my Ford Falcon trunk was full of Ralph Lindquist enabled trophies, so it was a proud day for me.</p>
<p class='left'>Vito was never much impressed with my leg splits or fancy kicks but he worked with me. I'll never forget, one night, when I finally whacked an opponent's (all the Harrisburg  adversaries were hard) chest with a counter punch. Vito was watching and exclaimed: <i>"I knew you had it in you.”</i> That comment was huge for me.</p>
<p class='left'>Vito was tall and very slender. When he sparred he handled the job like a confident surgeon. Most of the burly upper belts at the Harrisburg dojo were more akin to butchers than surgeons. Vito would calmly keep big opponents at bay with reach, speed, and expertise. His long thin arms were like whips and his kicks seemed to snake in like cobra strikes. As an architect the purpose, structure, and detail of kata were important to him and he excelled at all Isshinryu kata.</p>
<p class='left'>Vito once said to me, when I was sixteen, of Lindquist “He’s an unheralded hero.” As a teenager that loved Bruce Lee movies and the Kung Fu TV series, Lindquist fit my hero mold. Now, at sixty, my perspective of Sensei Lindquist’s hero mold has a far different shape than when I was sixteen.  </p>
<p class='left'>I could not get Vito to boast of his tournament exploits. I had seen Vito dominate at one tournament and I knew he did well at others. Vito did recount one experience: He was matched up against a student from Harry Smith’s Pittsburg dojo. All of Smith's students were hard competitors. Vito won the extremely nasty bout, but it resulted in a visit to hospital emergency with a split esophagus and a broken thumb. The Doctor wanted to do a tracheotomy for Vito’s breathing and pin the thumb’s carpal. Vito claims that because of his “arrogance and stupidity” he had the Doctor merely set the bone and wrap it. And, instead of a tracheotomy, he gave Vito pills to prevent swelling of the tracheal cartilage. The Doctor promised Vito that, if lived to the age of seventy, he would regret not following his advice. Vito was over seventy when I interviewed him for this book and he admits the Doctor was spot on and that he still suffers pain in the throat and thumb.</p>
<p class='left'>Speaking of arrogance and stupidity… this time mine with a strong reference to Vito. Again, when I was sixteen, Vito told me a story of how he was at one of Ralph’s martial arts presentations. Ralph announced that one of his students, Vito Coviello, would break eight bricks with a knuckle punch. Vito did not want to refuse his sensei and Ralph smiled approvingly after he completed a clean break. Vito told me recently that he never tried it again and:  “At that time I was a young Architect trying to earn a living and solidify my career, and was admonished by my employer about breaking more bones in my hands.” As a teenager, I was impressed with the concept of Vito performing knuckle breaks. No one did that. What you normally saw was bricks broken with hammer or palm strikes. The soft pad on your palm manages the cement quite well. But you punch with your knuckles. So, yeah, teenager me was impressed. I started regularly performing knuckle breaks at demonstrations. I never got up to eight bricks and I regularly broke the bursa in my knuckles.</p>
<p class='left'>Vito’s career took him to Saudi Arabia. He started a dojo in Saudi Arabia as he architected castles as he applied his architectural profession for five years. He promoted at least one black belt in that period. Vito moved back to the US and, for a time, owned a successful avocado ranch. Vito continued his martial arts training and received an honorary YonDon from International Shorin Ryu Karate Kobudo Federation in January 2003 from Kenneth Lyle Penland, Hanshi.</p>

<p class='left'>Vito had this to say about Lindquist: “I was very fortunate to have had three mentors at different stages in my lifetime to point me to the correct pathways. The catalyst mentor was Ralph who brought all aspects of my life together into one mass and showed me how it all should work.  Read, understand and live  ‘The Isshinryu Code’.”</p>

<h2>Bill Dollinger</h2>

<img src="../images/ch 7 dollinger vito sparring.jpg" class="center"</>
<div class="caption">Bill Dollinger and Vito Coviello in a Sparring Session</div>

<p class='left'>Ralph Lindquist called Bill Dollinger “Bull Dollinger” because he was a huge man that didn’t move when he sparred until he charged. </p>
<p class='left'>When I started, in 1973, Bill was always at Charles Miller’s York dojo classes. He taught me the basics and my first half-dozen Isshinryu kata. He attended Ralph Lindquist(‘s) classes in Harrisburg regularly. When I was fifteen years old, Bill offered to pick me up and take me to Ralph’s classes. I’d walk several miles to sit by the highway waiting for Bill. Ralph’s class was, at that point, at a Fire Station in Mechanicsburg. Most of the students were adults.</p>
<p class='left'>At that point, Bill was a school bus driver. There was one kid he got a kick out of and coerced him to come to class at Miller’s dojo. That kid was Jim Kotzman -- who became a Lindquist standout. Jim tells stories of how, when kids would start to fight on his bus, Bill would stop the bus and arrange what amounts to cage matches where he’d supervise somewhat controlled fights. </p>
<p class='left'>Sometimes Jim Kotzman would come along on the Bill Dollinger trips to Ralph’s mechanicsburg class. I remember one class where Bill and several of the other students went to a bar after class. Joe Salzinger (a state trooper) went to get a pitcher of beer and the bartender gave glasses of a count that included us two fifteen year olds (who were both pretty much full grown at that time.) </p>
<p class='left'>The three York black belts would fight every week. Each seemed to have their day. One week Bill was the man, the next week, Dick Rupert, and the next it was Frank Sciortino that was top dog. One week, Bill put blanks in a pistol and stuffed it into the front of his gi. Bill started to spar Dick and he loudly exclaimed: ““I never liked you.” He then janked out his pistol and shot at Dick twice. Understand that this would shock anybody but to Dick, who was a policeman, this shocked him more than most as the prospect of getting shot is a reality police deal with on a daily basis. It's a good thing Dick considered BIll a great friend.</p>
<p class='left'>Bill certainly was a character. Charles Miller told me a story of when his supervising manager had  a stay in York. Miller knew his manager enjoyed visiting classy bars. Miller suggested they’d visit some of York’s local bars. Miller slyly asked Bill to come along and quietly suggested to Bill they show this guy some of the darker bars in York (which Bill knew quite well). So the trio gets to a dive where there were some seedy looking people milling outside. Bill exclaims: “I knew we’d have to fight our way out, but it looks like we will have to fight our way in as well.”</p>
<p class='left'>Bill said to me, in reference to Sensei Lindquist, several times over a course of decades: <i>“There will never be another like him.”</i> Curiously I’ve heard this same statement from other Lindquist students, most notably George Dillman. </p>

<h2>Frank Sciortino</h2>

<p class='left'>I don’t have any crazy Bull Dollinger-like stories about Frank. He was a fine upstanding man, a mailman in fact. </p>
<p class='left'>One day, before class, I was watching Frank performing a kata. That kata looked amazing and I wondered which advanced kata it was and when I might learn it. Then I realized it was one of the basic H-form katas. In that instant my whole attitude about kata changed. Every move was to be done with vigor. After that moment, I took the execution of all kata seriously. </p>
<p class='left'>Frank had one fighting technique where he’d rush in like he was going to throw a reverse punch. You’d wait a second for it to come then figure it was a fake so you’d start to launch your own strike. Then, when you were least expecting it, Frank would finally throw that reverse punch and whack you.</p>
<p class='left'>I remember asking Sensei Frank, when I was about fourteen years old, how I would ever be able not to flinch and overreact when I was attacked. Frank said I would adapt as I got older and that I had  to keep sparing regularly. He was right. As I got a few years older opponents would give me a black eye or bloody nose and I’d respond with a laugh.</p>
<p class='left'>Patty Lipsett related a funny story about Frank. He was attending one of Ralph’s classes at the Harrisburg YMCA. At that point the YMCA had moved the class to a room in the basement. It looked like a dungeon with pipes dangling on the ceiling. One pipe had a five gallon bucket hung on it to capture drips from a toilet above. Frank was unaware of the bucket’s purpose and performed a leaping front kick to it. As he was performing this impressive kick, Patty yelled a warning... but it was too late. Frank worked out the rest of the class without his gi top, which had been stained with toilet drippings. </p>

<h2>Dick Rupert</h2>

<img src="../images/ch 7 dick rupert.jpg" class="center"</>
<div class="caption">Dick Rupert and Myself in a Sparring Session</div>

<p class='left'>I could write a book about Dick Rupert. Dick was a cop for Northern York Pennsylvania Regional Police. I trained under Dick when I was a teenager and there were a half-a-dozen times where I got out of trouble with local police because I knew Dick Rupert. </p>
<p class='left'>When I was eighteen I got a job as a fitness instructor at Jim Dohm’s Health Club. Jim let police attend the gym free of charge. I’d be sleeping at the entryway desk in the afternoon and Dick Rupert would pop in. He’d snarl to me: <i>“Let’s spar.”</i> So I’d put on a gi or sweat pants and we’d battle in the free exercise gym. I do mean battle. At eighteen I was a pretty serious contender and Dick was one hard man. One day we slammed up against one of the six foot mirrors and smashed it. I always had problems sparring Rupert. As I began to compete well against other local talent, I started to think I just didn’t know how to fight Dick. But then I saw him spare a few of my non-Isshinryu notable black belt friends and I realized just how good Dick Rupert really was. I then acknowledged how much our sparring sessions helped me become adept.</p>

[photo of Dick and me at Dohms]


<p class='left'>Ralph Lindquist gave belt advancements formally at the beginning of test night, which was every other month. In 1977 Ralph advanced Vito to Sandon and Bill and Frank to Nidan. Dick Rupert was present at that class and did not receive advancement. Vito asked me weeks later if I thought Dick had been upset about not receiving Nidan. I told Vito that I didn’t think so but, whereas he, Bill, and Frank had all dedicated effort to teaching at the dojos, Dick was often absent. I continued to tell Vito that what Sensei may not know is that Dick Rupert had dedicated himself to providing self-defense classes to women. He gave those classes regularly in the York area. I knew because I’d show up to help (and then Dick would thank me by kicking my ass in after class sparring sessions.)</p>


<p class='left'>One day Rupert once came into Jim Dohm’s Health Club a little agitated. While on duty he had been called to a hospital where a big guy was getting overly physical and belligerent. Dick said he walked up to the guy and said softly <i>“Come on, let’s go.”</i> And then he put his right arm up like he was going to put it around him. Only it wasn’t an embracing arm wrap. It was a reverse back fist that hit the guy on his temple. The big man dropped straight down. Dick said to me: <i>“I thought I killed him.”</i> But the man was OK.</p>


    <p class='left'>I spoke with Dick Rupert at Ralph Lindquist’s funeral. Understand, though, that before we spoke, we kind of looked over each other silently saying: <i>“Come on. Right now. Let’s go.”</i> Of course we didn’t break out into battle, which is good as, although I was in my fifties and Dick was in his mid sixties, he was still fighting competitively -- we may have broken another mirror!</p>

<h2>Steve Angeli, Glenn Dively, and Joe Salzinger</h2>
<p class='left'>In the seventies Ralph’s dojo was full of exemplary brown belts. The three that are unforgettable to me are Steve Angeli, Glenn Dively, and Joe Salzinger.  Glenn Dively was a big hard man. He wasn’t great at kata but he loved to fight. It was one thing to have black belts that you knew could pick you apart but it was crazy when there were several two hundred pound or so brown belts that could easily break ribs and knock you out. It made for some pretty serious training. Joe was a Pennsylvania State policeman that I covered in the prior chapter. Steve Angeli began training under Ralph when he was a teenager with little focus. Karate gave him focus. Besides becoming a winning competitor at tournaments, he became a state level sprinter. Those fast and powerful legs made his kicks amazing. I emulated my kicks after his. The focus he acquired from martial arts helped Steve become a heart surgeon. I recall Vito saying: “Steve came to this dojo a boy and left a man.”</p>

<h2>A Marine Challenge</h2>


<p class='left'>In the mid seventies, when Ralph’s dojo was still at the refurbished bar, a trio of hot shot Marine graduates stopped by what they thought was still a bar. They watched class for a bit then rudely called out a challenge to fight. The heavy hitters of Salzinger, Dively, Bretz, or Vito must not have been there that night. Ralph told them they’d have to wait until after class. A. J. Boyd, a white belt at that time, waited outside while these rough recruits showed the karate instructor (whom they had no idea was a decorated special forces war hero) how tough they were. Ralph quickly put one man down, then a second. To the third he said: “Do you want to spar or carry your friends out?” He did the smart thing and helped his Marine buddies out of the bar-turned-dojo. This “wait till after class” was apparently a thing with Ralph. Miller told me similar stories from the sixties. In one story a big guy waited till after class. He had a pack of cigarettes in his shirt pocket. The first technique Ralph threw was a roundhouse that crushed the cigarettes. </p>

<h2>Lord Beans </h2>


<p class='left'>Lord Beans (otherwise known as the Isshinryu dog) was Lindquist’s beloved Boston Terrier. When Ralph would come home from class clad in his gi, Lord Beans would grab his obi and Ralph would spin Bean around in mid-air. Sensei always treated Beans like a gentleman. He would grome him weekly. As Ralph neatly trimmed his whiskers, Beans would sit motionless. Vito remembers Ralph flipping Beans a bottle cap and, in about 5 minutes, he would spit out a flat piece of metal that resembled a nickel.  </p>


<p class='left'>Lord Beans was also known as the Isshinryu dog because he was a gift from Charles Miller’s York dojo. Ralph had lost a Boston Terrier called Fendle. He was half-heartedly adamant about not getting another. But Miller collaborated with Ralph’s wife, Beverly, and they contacted a breeder. Boston Terriers require cesarean sections for 80% of births so they are expensive and are often hard to acquire. Miller’s York Isshinryu club had one heart and mind and all contributed to the purchase of the Boston Terrier that  Ralph named Lord Beans (for Boston baked beans.)</p>

<h2>The Samurai of York Little Theater </h2>

<p class='left'>I was once at one of my wife’s family gatherings. Her family was more into music and theater than sports (much less martial arts.) Anyway, at that gathering I met a man who was a regular actor at the York Little Theater. Of course, I mentioned karate and this fellow asked if I knew Ralph Lindquist. What? This short, dumpy, thespian, singer, musician knew Ralph Lindquist? He explained that he was in a play that required a sword fight. They asked around for someone that could choreograph and train them. Ralph Lindquist was recommended. Ralph travelled to York and choreographed a detailed sword fight. The audience was shocked: in that scene sparks were flying during the sword fight and the audience was astounded -- they were expecting swordplay and not a real sword fight.</p>
<p class='left'>I’ve heard other stories of Ralph giving his time to work with people he otherwise had no relationship with. I’m sure there are many others. I’ll give you another quick one: Patty Lipsett once saw a Rolls Royce stretch limo sitting in front of the Blue Cross Blue Shield building. It had a chauffeur leaning dutifully against the driver’s door.  Patty couldn’t resist and asked the chauffeur if the battery was in the boot in that model (that way he’d know she was familiar with Rolls). They got into a conversion and she learned the Rolls belonged to the owner of Vartan Group (a huge real estate firm). It turns out that Vartan personally asked Ralph Lindquist to teach his chauffeur some self-defense and bodyguard moves.  </p>

<h2>Charles Miller’s Arrest</h2>

<p class='left'>Ralph and Charles had been close friends since the mid 1960s. Ralph was Charles’s best man. Ralph arraigned for Charles to be arrested after the wedding rehearsal. A huge policeman cornered Charles and asked him to get in his patrol car so he could take him downtown for questioning. Charles refused. But Ralph, the nice man that he was, said he’d go along to the station with him and they’d sort things out quickly. So Ralph and Charles pop into the patrol car that drove them, not to the police station, but to a bachelor's party. I was barely sixteen, but I was at that party. </p>
<p class='left'>At the wedding the next day, many attendees wore traditional German outfits. At the reception, Miller was given a beer stein that was probably three feet tall and full of brew. He was told, for good luck, the custom was the stein must be emptied. Everyone helped. I had a go myself (again, I was 16.) But I’ll never forget Sensei Lindquist in a deep sei-uchin stance holding that monstros beer stein on one elbow and assisting in the cause of good luck. </p>
<p class='left'>Ralph Lindquist and his wife Beverly actually went on Charles Miller and his new wife MaryLou’s honeymoon to Germany. I remember Ralph telling me: “You can drink a different beer there everyday and never try them all.” Knowing Ralph wasn’t a drinker, I asked him: “How many did you try?” He said: “Oh, we tried all of them.”</p>

  <h1>The Capitalist</h1>
</center>


<img src="../images/ch 8 p3 wraith ralph.JPG" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Ralph with the Phantom III and the Silver Wraith</div>

<p class='left'>When Ralph Lindquist was a young man he established three goals:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Own a Rolex watch</li>
  <li>Own a Brooks Brothers suit</li>
  <li>Own a Rolls Royce</li>
</ol>

<p class='left'>There was little chance that a man without any formal college education and from blue-collar Scranton PA (a city in severe industrial decline) would acquire any of those. </p>

<h2>What motivated Lindquist to make those goals?</h2>

<p class='left'>As to the Rolex: When Ralph was a teenager, a post W( watches that had been made explicitly for soldiers. Construction workers were smashing war surplus with bulldozers. As a wandering teenager, Ralph spotted this wasteful use of unsaleable quality watches, ran up, and pilfered a few. One of those rescued Bulova watches was of high quality and Ralph kept it for the remainder of his life. The Bolivar introduced him to quality timepieces that were manufactured with careful craftsmanship. The Rolex was the best timepiece available.</p>
<p class='left'>As to the Brooks Brothers suit: In the nineteen forties, quality clothing separated the classes. Back then folks didn’t go out without being well dressed. Still, people were able to easily discern the quality of suit one was wearing. </p>
<p class='left'>As to the Rolls Royce: Ralph was a mechanic. In fact, he procured his own auto service center before he was twenty. Again, like Rolex watches and Brooks Brothers suits, a Rolls Royce was the top quality automobile. Ralph appreciated handmade goods. Merchandise from Rolex, Brooks Brothers, and Rolls Royce were all handcrafted. In short, I think Ralph wanted to get there on time, looking good, and in style. Ralph foresaw himself going about his day well dressed, wearing a quality timepiece, and driving in an excellent car.</p>
<p class='left'>There may have been little chance of Ralph achieving those three goals but he overshot those objectives. He later owned, not just a Rolex, but a jewelry store; he owned not just one Rolls Royce but three; and he became president of a Rolls Royce club. On all pertinent occasions, Ralph was impeccably dressed. Even at the dojo, Ralph’s gi was always pristine white and clean. He would adjust the gis automatically. He used to say: <i>“Neatness is a politeness.”</i></p>
<h2>Blue Collar Struggle</h2>
<p class='left'>Before he was twenty Ralph had somehow procured, owned, and operated his own auto service center.  He had previously worked for a cigar manufacturer (one little known quirk about Sensei was that he would enjoy a fine cigar every week or so). The Korean war pulled Ralph away from his auto service business. But he kept his goal of financial independence. When he was at the Army base, he would make small change ironing clothes for his fellow recruits that wanted to look good when they went out on pass. Meanwhile, throughout the war, while most soldiers were blowing their meager pay, Ralph was setting much of his aside.</p>
<p class='left'>After the Korean war, when Ralph went back to civilian life, using his knowledge as a mechanic, he got a job as an auto insurance claims inspector for Erie insurance. Ralph was diligent at everything he did and claims was no different. One interesting story came about while he was investigating insurance fraud. He traced leads to a body and fender shop. Ralph could hear people inside but the doors were locked and no one responded to his knocks. So Ralph climbed up to a second floor window and peered inside to see a man spray painting a car. The fellow spotted Ralph and came over and spray painted the window so he could no longer see. Ralph went to a second window, and a third, and the man continued to spray shut the view. But, at that point, Ralph had all the information he needed. Most claims investigators would have been reticent to put themselves in harms way with criminals but this war hero martial arts expert wasn’t overly concerned.</p>
<p class='left'>Ralph continued to work his way up the ladder at Erie insurance. The insurance company’s co-founder O.H. Hirt created the company with the mantra: “ERIE is Above all in sERvIcE.” The E R I E in the company name came from the uppercase vowels in the word service. Early in Ralph’s career at Erie, Hirt was coming into town so management assigned a lesser employee to drive him around. That “lesser” man was Ralph Lindquist. The two hit it off immediately. Ralph became good friends with this billionaire creator of a Fortune 500 company. Whenever Hirt was in Harrisburg he would insist Ralph be available to drive and otherwise pal around with him. Ralph would regularly have Hirt over to his home for dinner parties. The following lists (Source: About Hirt https://www.erieinsurance.com/blog/wit-and-wisdom) Hirt’s philosophy and they mesh well with Ralph’s, and I’m sure that’s why they became friends:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Know your stuff. Believe your stuff. Do your stuff.</li>
  <li> That one word “Harmony” says everything.</li>
  <li> Knowledge is power – and we want everyone in our organization to have all the power that education can give them.</li>
  <li> Never lose human touch.</li>
  <li> Insist upon thinking.</li>
  <li> Hold fast to that which is good.</li>
  <li> The secret of successful salesmanship is giving enough people the opportunity to say yes to the right proposition.</li>
  <li> Success in business is not a matter of tricks or gimmicks, or even of education and training. It is just a matter of simple common sense, mixed with just plain decency.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Flea Markets and Yard Sales</h2>
<p class='left'>I remember one Saturday, in the late eighties, when Ralph had driven down to visit my York dojo. I met him at his car and we began walking to the dojo. Our progress was impeded by a one-day street-side flea market. I waited, very impatiently, as Ralph carefully looked over everything on a series of tables. In my opinion, it was all junk. But my “opinion” was of little value and meant next to nothing. Had there been anything that wasn’t junk, Ralph would have spotted it. Ralph had been frequenting flea markets, yard and estate sales for decades. He went to auctions so regularly that he was often asked to be the caller. Vito Coviello told me that Ralph took him to many auctions where Ralph mentored him on the acquisition of quality oriental knotted rugs. Today Vito has a large collection of extremely valuable rugs.</p>
<p class='left'>Most everyone has had, at one point or another, a yard sale. You’d have it on a Saturday and you would put notice in a local paper saying that it started at nine AM. But someone always seemed to be ringing your doorbell at seven AM. If you lived in the Harrisburg area, that person, very likely, was Ralph Lindquist. He’d be dressed in his favorite bib overalls and he’d be driving a Volkswagen Rabbit. If you had something that interested him, he’d bargain on price (using the colloquial language of the son of a blue collar PA steel town) and you had no idea the item was of extreme value or that the buyer could have driven a Rolls Royce rather than a VW Rabbit.</p>
<p class='left'>Many of the items Ralph had acquired from these yard sales, flea markets, auctions, and estate sales he later sold at Harristown Jewelers.  Harristown Jewelers was the store he opened in the early seventies with Dave Ferris, one of his black belts. Before the jewelry store, Ralph was selling valuables acquired at yard sales and flea markets at actions and through newspaper classifieds. He would often buy paintings, not for their artwork, but for its quality frame. He used to say: “Time, place, and circumstance.” </p>

<h2>Rolex</h2>
<p class='left'>Ralph had a small collection of antique Rolexes, which he always wore. He once said: “The purposefulness of something is in its use.”  Vito was impressed with Ralph’s love of Rolexes and purchased a stainless steel “DateJust” for $250. It had an oculus showing the new date each day. Just after Ralph acquired Harristown Jewelers, he called Vito and asked him if he was interested in a new Rolex ordered by someone who later decided to not complete the purchase.  Ralph offered Vito the opportunity to purchase the new GMT, gold and stainless steel, Rolex for $800 plus his old Rolex. Vito agreed and he has worn that watch for 42 years. Recently he had the watch serviced.  The jeweler was enamored with the antique and offered Vito $3,000 to purchase it. Vito continues to wear that watch every day.</p>


<h2>Property and Investments</h2>

<p class='left'>Ralph used to say: “Never fall in love with a piece of real estate.” I’m not sure how much property Ralph owned but I know he and Vito Coviello created a formal partnership and bought multiple properties together. I also know some of my fellow karateka worked on some of Ralph’s rental properties. Vito told me:</p>
<p class='left'>After moving to California it was decided to sell our properties. While living in California for almost 40 years I began to buy various types of property such as condos, houses and ranch property.  Fortunately for me, Ralph’s business acumen helped me solidify my security for the rest of my life.”</p>
<p class='left'>Ralph Lindquist also dabbled in the markets. Again, from Vito:</p>

<p class='left'>
  <i>Sensei was an investor and businessman.  He was also a private man.  It took some time to crack his protective shell, and when it happened, we were able to communicate.  I loved the concept of investing and one of its paths, the stock market.  For several years I ate my lunch at a local Harrisburg Brokerage firm  looking at the Tape and reading/learning.  Ralph helped me understand the system which helped me make money.</i>
</p>


<p class='left'>Sensei Miller lived in York but worked in Harrisburg. He would sometimes drop in unexpectedly at Ralph’s home in Mechanicsburg. One Tuesday night he popped in and was turned away by Ralph’s wife Beverly.  Beverly initially simply said: “It’s Tuesday.” But, seeing Charley’s confused look, Beverly explained that every Tuesday night, Lindquist dedicated the evening to working on his finances. Tuesdays make sense to me now as Karate class had been held on Monday and Thursday nights for decades. Besides dabbling in the stock market, Ralph would move his banking -- often weekly -- even when the point change was as little as half-a-percent.</p>
<p class='left'>At times Ralph would tell us kids (like Jim Kotzman and I, when we were in our early twenties) to put money into a 401K. “Even if it’s a dollar a week,” he’d say. I didn’t and, unlike Vito, I haven’t “solidified my security for the rest of my life.” </p>
<p class='left'>One curious and somewhat funny thing about Ralph was that he always played the lottery. I’ve heard some very smart people say that playing the lottery is an intelligence test. Ralph didn’t pass their test but he only ever bought one ticket. I heard him say many times: <i>“Until I win the lottery….”</i> It was funny to hear about this man -- with a jewelry store, properties, a well paid job, and several Rolls Royces -- playing the lottery. </p>
<p class='left'>I used to drive some veritable klunkers from York PA to class in Harrisburg. But I had no payments on them. Ralph used to say: <i>“If you aren’t making car payments, you are making money driving that car.”</i> In fact, while I never heard Ralph brag about his Rolls Royce’s, I did hear him brag about another car. One day I met him at a Saturday class at Dave Bretz’s house. Ralph drove up in a Volkswagen Rabbit. He got out, patted the car hood and said: <i>“Nice car. Good car. Company car.”</i> His job at Erie Insurance didn’t really warrant him having a company car but he figured out a way to get one. He certainly was “making money” driving that VW rather than making payments on a standard upper middle class automobile.</p>

<h2>Rolls Royce</h2>

<p class='left'>Ralph’s VW wasn’t his only car. As this book’s cover shows, he owned a Rolls Royce. It had been one of his life’s goals to own a Rolls Royce. From making small change ironing fellow GI clothes, to gaining half-percentage points on savings, playing the stock market, buying and selling property, and making top dollar at Erie insurance, by the late nineteen sixties, Ralph had more than enough money to buy a Rolls Royce. But, like everything else he did, Ralph wanted to do it right and get the best Rolls Royce he could. He found a 1956 Silver Wraith that was for sale in England. </p>
<p class='left'>But there was a problem with buying that Silver Wraith: The owner refused to sell unless he met and approved the buyer. The owner was Lord Clark. That’s right: he was British Royalty with a title. He was also known as Major Clark as he had an outstanding career in the British military. After Ralph Lindquist and Lord Clark communicated several times, it was agreed that Ralph and Beverly would visit Lord Clark by staying at the manor house on his estate for a week or so. During that visit, Ralph and Beverly went on the Wholly Ghost tour from England through Ireland and Scotland. </p>
<p class='left'>Lord Clark liked Ralph and Beverly so much that he not only agreed to the sale but he personally managed the containerization and paid for its shipping to the United States.</p>
<p class='left'>Understand that, until the sixties, all Silver Wraiths were custom made to order. The Rolls that British royalty would order would have been something special. And this one was. Most Rolls Royce were designed with the concept of a paid driver. The back seat is where much of the finery was added. This one had dove gray leather seats, matching gray shearling foot mats, airline type tray tables in the back seats. In the back seat, you’d push a button over your left shoulder and a double door would open in the middle of the back seat for a decanter of liquid refreshment.</p>

<img src="../images/ch 8 RR Wraith back seat.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Back seat of the Silver Wraith</div>

<p class='left'>Ralph Lindquist asked Charley Miller to drive down with him to the Dundalk Marine Terminal in Maryland. It arrived in a sealed shipping container. Ralph drove the Wraith back to York (and then Harrisburg) while Charles drove Ralph’s commuter car.</p>


<p class='left'>Lindquist jumped into the world of Rolls Royce with the same fervor as martial arts. He joined several Rolls Royce clubs and began to compete in events. His Silver Wraith won top honors in his first competition. Ralph enjoyed the folk from the Rolls Royce clubs. He often took Charles Miller or Vito Coviello to events. He would mention to them before the event to observe specific people. Many of the members of the various Rolls Royce clubs of which Ralph was affiliated were of old, old money. One couple was Ken and Mermie Karger. They were editors of the magazine The Flying Lady (named after the Rolls-Royce hood ornament.) They had money that was several generations old. Yet Ken's normal attire was a green military surplus coat that had rip and tear corrections made with duct tape. But they were also very down to earth and educated. Ralph had them at his home for dinner parties. Memie Karger, in one of her editorial pieces said: <i>“Although I have a passable knowledge of the workings of my Ghost, it was fascinating to learn more of the whys and wherefores (as Ralph Lindquist used to say) of those earlier and later than mine.”</i></p>
<p class='left'>A few years after acquiring the Silver Wraith, Ralph procured a 1937 Rolls-Royce Phantom III hard top. It had 12 cylinders and 24 spark plugs. One story Raph told about the P3: He and Beverly were driving it on a Wholly Ghost tour in the Great Smoky Mountains. They were in the right lane driving uphill. A couple of young guys in a sports type car drew alongside. Ralph put his foot on the gas and pulled ahead a little. The sports car did the same. Ralph accelerated again and they matched them. Then, for the final time… Ralph turned, smiled at them, waived and put more pressure on the gas pedal. The Rolls sped out of sight as they continued climbing the mountain. That sports car couldn’t keep up with 12 cylinders!</p>
<p class='left'>The P3 was also a touring car; it had an eighty Imperial gallon gas tank. Ralph used to enjoy pulling it up at a filling station and asking the attendant to fill it up. One poor fellow got on his hands and knees as he was looking for a leak as the pump kept going! George Dillman told me he went on a long road trip with Ralph in the P3 and was a bit nervous about the fact that it did not have a gas gauge. Lindquist did talk Dillman into buying a Rolls-Royce. Dillman had it for years then sold it, at a profit, to a man that wanted to drive it in a parade in California. </p>
<p class='left'>Ralph later replaced the P3 with a 1925 Silver Ghost Phantom II drop top (shown in the photo above alongside the Silver Wraith). Ralph went on many road trips with the Silver Ghost including one that went through Washington State, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana.</p>
<p class='left'>Ralph continued to exhibit his Rolls-Royces at competitions. He always did his own work. Friends and family knew to save old toothbrushes so Ralph could use them to clean the engines and undersides of his Rolls-Royces before competitions. </p>
<p class='left'>I want to close this section with a story about what kind of man this was that had multiple Rolls-Royces and crazy wealthy friends: There was a neighborhood teenager that jokingly mentioned to Ralph about using his Rolls-Royce for his prom. Ralph shocked him by agreeing he’d drive him. As always, Ralph did it in style. He did the complete chauffeur thing -- which included wearing a black suit and chauffeur’s hat. He opened and closed the doors for the teenage couple and waited, dutifully, in the parking lot, while the teenagers enjoyed their prom. </p>


<h2>Road to Wealth</h2>
<p class='left'>This book is about a martial arts pioneer, more so than the monetary wealth spoken of in this chapter. Many of Ralph Lindquists martial arts peer group became wealthy from teaching and promoting karate, such as the industry luminaries of: Danny Pai, George Dillman, George Iberl, Ed Parker, and Jhoon Rhee. Yet Ralph never looked for limelight or wealth for teaching karate. One Christmas season, the regularly attending black belts (Bretz, Kotzman, Wolfe, Messersmith and myself) were discussing what to give Ralph as an honorary Holiday gift. I suggested a million dollars! I explained that Ralph was a capitalist yet he made nothing from teaching us (at the time we were at the Harrisburg YMCA and there were no instructional fees.) So I suggested, to show our appreciation, we’d get a plaque made that held a metal check for a million dollars and the endorsers would be all of us black belts. We procured an engraver who created a metal check with copies of our signatures. When I presented the plaque to Sensei Lindquist I stated: <i>“We hope you don’t cash this but rather let it continue to appreciate. Our appreciation for you is already worth more than a million dollars.”</i></p>

<div class="caption">Ralph Lindquist awarding me with a sandan certificate</div>

<p class='left'>From the middle of the 1970s till the early 1980s, I was, as Tim Messersmith, one of my black belts, recently confided to me, a karate bum. I had been a fat uncoordinated kid that had been cut from every sport I tried out for. At thirteen, I dedicated myself to karate. Karate's scientific approach of training and learning at your specific pace worked for me. I became obsessed. At seventeen I got a job as a trainer at a fitness gym. I lifted weights, bicycled everywhere, ran regularly, and competed in road races. All that was to be fit for attending karate class four to five times a week and compete in tournaments and boxing events. I started my own karate class at the fitness club but continued to attend Lindquist classes at the Harrisburg YMCA twice a week. During that period I accumulated some of the best karate training partners one could hope for: David Bretz and James Kotzman. In the 1980s I promoted several students to black belt myself. Each tested under a board that included Lindquist and they were awarded the coveted black belt certificate from Sensei Lindquist. At the award ceremony, I’d hand them their black belt and Lindquist would hand them their certificate. </p>
<p class='left'>I’m calling the late seventies and eighties the era of Bretz, Kotzman, and Denoncourt. We led class and we trained and sparred lower belts till they became good (or great) fighters themselves. An example of a great fighter was Michael Einsig, who went by the moniker of Iron Mike as a successful full contact kickboxer (with Kotzman as his trainer). We competed regularly, and successfully, at tournaments and kickboxing events. We were sensei. Our master was O-Sensei-sama Ralph Lindquist.</p>



<h2>Bretz</h2>

<img src="../images/ch 9 bretz kusanku 3 front kick backfist.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Bretz in Kata competition</div>

<p class='left'>David Bretz was a gifted athlete. In high school he was named first team for Pennsylvania’s All-State football and he was also a champion wrestler. When I was a sixteen year old attending classes at Ralph’s Harrisburg dojo, Bretz was one of those that regularly beat the crap out of me. Actually, it was just bruising of the chest, ribs, and arms with an occasional bloody lip or nose. A few years later, after sparring regularly with some locally competitive Shotokan and Tae Kwon Do martial artists, I once again began to visit the Lindquist dojo. I sparred Bretz and, in his words, he couldn’t touch me as he couldn’t get past my kicks. We became training partners and close friends. He’d come down on Saturday mornings to work out at Jim Dohm’s Health Club, where I was an instructor and manager. We’d do Karate training for two hours then lift weights for another hour or two.</p>
<p class='left'>We had an open workout format and a steady stream of local Karateka regularly stopped by to spar. Dave also trained under one of the best boxing trainers in Harrisburg (who went by the nickname of Sweetcakes.) My kicks were spot on but Bretz trained my hands. At the tournaments, Dave would always line up with the toughest looking competitor for kumite.</p>
<p class='left'>There was one tournament where O-Sensei Ralph Lindquist and Sensei Ron Lawrence both attended. They judged black belt kata. I took second and Bretz took third. The guy that took first place was truly amazing. Bretz tied for third so he had to do another kata, and took third. Later Sensei made very sure to tell me that Bretz's second kata was better than my first one. A comment I took as a compliment as we were kata training partners.</p>


<img src="../images/ch 9 ron ralph black belt kata judging.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Ron Lawrence and Ralph Lindquist judging Black Belt competition</div>


<p class='left'>Bretz had been a tough guy before training in the martial arts. One night he was at a bar and a guy challenged Dave. Dave slammed him up against the wall and told him: “Don’t mess with me.” Later that night, as Dave was leaving the bar, the guy was waiting outside the door and whalloped Dave on his nose with a queue ball. Dave was in the hospital for weeks.</p>
<p class='left'>For years Dave, who always frequented bars, looked for this man. Five years or so later, after boxing training, a bit of Judo, and a Lindquist black belt, Dave spotted the guy at a bar. He walked up to him and said: "Remember me?" The guy must have recognized Dave because he immediately took a swing at him. Big mistake. Bretz had this looping overhand right. He wanted you to block it as he’d torque his elbow up and drive down with his massive forearms into, thoughtfully and kindly, your chest. I knew that punch quite well (having been hit with it often while it was encased in a padded glove.) That guy didn’t know that punch. Dave hit him once, not so kindly though, in the face. The guy collapsed. Dave left. </p>
<p class='left'>The police put out a warrant for the arrest of Dave and his "gang" that beat the hell out of the poor guy in the hospital. From the bruising on his face, the police figured the victim had been punched and kicked multiple times. That gang was but one of Dave’s punches. The police picked Dave up but soon let him go after they discovered there were multiple warrants out for Mr. Queball -- who turned out to be not a fine and upstanding member of society. The police then inquired of Dave where he had received his martial arts training.</p>

<p class='left'>Lindquist’s classes on Monday and Thursday nights with Dave and Jim were the bastion of my training. Dave and I typically led classes while Ralph gave one-on-one instruction in the back. </p>
<p class='left'>Here’s a note Patty Lipsett sent me about our classes:</p>

<p class='left'><i>“I remember when we started you and Dave ran class, alternating techniques and the class just died trying to keep up.”</i></p>
<p class='left'><i>“Best shape I have ever been in!”</i></p>
<p class='left'><i>“One night Jack and I drove home after class, we were too tired to climb out of the van. We sat for over 10 minutes not able to move.”</i></p>
<p class='left'><i>“‘Yup, time to go in’ ...(no movement),  ‘let’s go’ (no movement), and our gi’s were soaked with sweat and reeked. We had to wash with bleach to get the smell out.”</i></p>
<p class='left'><i>“‘Those were the days!”</i></p>



<img src="../images/ch 9 bretz kicking Ron Ralph watching.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Bretz kicking the hand bag held by Ron Lawrence, Ralph watching</div>

<p class='left'>Despite Dave’s punching prowess, when he sparred he typically tried to score with kicks. Dave knew he could take out most anybody, at any time, with a punch. My punches never got as good as Dave’s and his kicks never got as good as mine but both of us evolved into better martial artists because of each other’s strengths. </p>
<p class='left'>Dave had another incident at the dojo. Some idiot came to the YMCA literally looking for a fight. He first went to the Judo class but had no takers. Then he came to our class and billerently hollered: “Anyone want to fight.” Bretz walked to the back of the room and the guy assumed a wrestling stance. Bretz front kicked him and, as he bounced off the wall, Bretz began pummeling him with punches. Sensei Lindquist gingerly tried to pull Bretz off the guy but was concerned about receiving a wild haymaker himself. When Bretz stopped, the fellow quickly ran off. The guy had no idea Dave was pulling his punches!</p>
<p class='left'>When I first began working out with David Bretz, he was a plumber for the railroad. But, like most Lindquist students, he continually improved himself both in and out of the dojo. He started a successful lawn care business, with multiple trucks, and garnered contracts from large companies. He went back to college and got a degree in engineering. He then had a successful career building bridges for the state of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class='left'>Dave had to have spinal surgery in his neck when he was maybe forty years old. Ralph told me a story about him visiting Dave at the hospital. Ralph was helping Dave do a tentative walk around the hallways, to become comfortable walking again. Ralph said there was a man and wife arguing and Dave was getting upset with the guy. He told Sensei he was going to do something. Ralph asked him: “What are you going to do?” And Dave responded: “Just push me into him. I’ll take care of it.” Luckily for the arguing husband, Ralph didn’t lob Dave at him.</p>
<p class='left'>Conversely, Dave told me at Sensei’s funeral that in his last days, Sensei let Dave know that he didn’t want to be visited while he was at the hospital. Dave said that he didn’t care, he still visited him. I said: “Sensei visited you when you weren’t doing that well either.” Dave said: “That’s right.”</p>
<p class='left'>Ralph would visit Dave’s overly equipped home gym once a week to “pump rubber,” as he called it. One of the pieces of equipment Dave had used powerful rubber bands for resistance. Lindquist admitted to me that he mostly went to Dave’s gym to promote camaraderie within the Karate club members. Besides, his doing a couple hundred pushups and other exercises during class a couple of times a  week probably obviated the requirement for any kind of weight training.</p>

<h2>James Kotzman</h2>

<img src="../images/ch 9 kotzman kickboxing win.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Jim's kickboxing win</div>


<p class='left'>Well, Jim Kotzman, although his mother once told me: <i>“His name is not Jim, we christened him James.”</i></p>
<p class='left'>Jim and I started training at the same time at Charles Miller’s York dojo. Jim was, as was everybody in his large family, an athlete. But, after about a year of karate and obtaining his green belt, Kotzman took off a few years. His football and wrestling coach, also a karate black belt, persuaded Jim to dedicate himself, as his brothers before him, to sports at York Catholic High. Jim played varsity football starting in the ninth grade. </p>
<p class='left'>I ran into Jim at York College and coerced him into returning to karate training. That training was two one-on-one workouts a week at Jim Dohm Health Club and two classes a week at Lindquist’s Harrisburg YMCA dojo. We became constant training partners. We even went on runs together and competed in amature boxing competitions. Like Lindquist and Dillman, when I was a brown belt, Jim was a green belt and when I was a black belt, he was a brown belt. But, as I said, Jim was an athlete and I never really had the upper hand on Jim in kumite. </p>
<p class='left'>I competed in the black belt division for several years before I was awarded my black belt. I would borrow a black belt from Charles Miller. After I had borrowed Sensei Miller’s belt several times and he finally said: “Keep it.” Soon thereafter, I was awarded my black belt and Kotzman, still a brown belt, was competing in the black belt division. I loaned Jim Sensei Miller’s black belt and told him that I was going to say the same thing Miller had said to me and that he should “keep it.” That belt, worn and frayed, is hanging up today in Kotzman’s dojo and workout gym. Miller received that black belt from Lindquist and so karatedo moved forward from Lindquist, to Miller, to me and Jim.</p>
<p class='left'>From about the time Jim and I were eighteen to twenty-one years old we were constant training partners. He was at my parents house so often he began to notice my younger sister. My grandfather was confused and asked: “Is Jim your friend or Carol’s.” I, helpfully, answered: “You’ll have to ask Jim that.” They later married and, just as I did, had three boys. </p>
<p class='left'>Jim continued to improve himself in and out of the dojo. Jim finished college, became a high school history teacher, and was a highschool wrestling coach. He also was a heavily sought out personal trainer for some of the top collegiate wrestlers in southern Pennsylvania. </p>

<img src="../images/ch 9 kotzman in gi.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Jim's kickboxing win</div>

<p class='left'>Here are some of Jim’s personal thoughts on Sensei:</p>


<p class='left'>
  <i>“As for life lessons they are endless: How to openly  greet people, with a smile and a very firm handshake.  Where to position yourself in any social situation to be able to observe and vacate quickly if necessary!  How to read people and their possible motives.  Sensei drew you in, you always wanted more of him. So I spent many years making that trip up to Harrisburg.  I will always remember his eyes, they twinkled, when he spoke. ”</i></p>

<p class='left'><i>“Life lesson #200 Haha how to adjust to different social situations.  He could talk shit with a bunch of drunk young guys, and two minutes later hold a deep discussion with an Academician. He taught me how to be both physically and emotionally strong because without both you really have nothing.  He taught the lesson of hard knocks, meaning the more you wanted something you better be ready to pay the cost. I really could go on and on like I said his lessons never ended and went way past Karate techniques. ”</i> </p>


<p class='left'><i>“A few of Sensei's sayings I recall:”</i> </p>


<i>“"If you're not where you are, you're nowhere"”</i>
<i>“"Never break a promise, just be careful how many you make"”</i>


<p class='left'><i>“People at work used to ask if I ever had to use my training? I always very confidently responded “every single minute of every day…”  Sensei taught us how to be good honorable people willing to face any situation thrown our way!”</i></p>

<h2>Disrespect and Stupidity</h2>


<p class='left'>Bretz, Kotzman, and myself had an immense respect for O-Sensei Lindquist. But there was this guy… a multi-style black belt who would regularly visit the Harrisburg dojo. He was pretty good but perhaps a bit bombastic. He’d rarely spar Bretz, Kotzman, or myself because we’d whup up on him pretty hard as he’d attempt fancy kicks and moves. Plus he was a bit too arrogant of his black belts from multiple styles. One night none of us of comparable age and rank were at class. So this butthead asked O-Sensei Lindquist to spar. That was the ultimate in disrespect. Lindquist was an advanced Sensei, a master, a karate pioneer that was three decades this guy’s senior. It was also stupid as Ralph was a veteran of military conflict where he killed people in hand to hand combat. Anyway, this goof started to bear down hard on Sensei. A.J. noticed the aggression and, recognizing Ralph’s demeanor, and, having witnessed similar scenarios before, removed all the students from the room saying “You don’t need to see this.”</p>
<p class='left'>I’m not sure exactly what transpired but that multi-style black belt never showed his face again at our dojo.</p>


<h2>Trouble</h2>


<p class='left'>Trouble is my little brother: littler by nine years. I started bringing Robert along to my jaunts to the Harrisburg YMCA dojo when he was in third or fourth grade. He was hyperactive and, to say the least, he had problems concentrating at school. However, at karate class, for some reason, he did all the exercises and worked out diligently. Still, before and after class, he’d do appalling things and was, overall, generally rude. When we’d arrive at class Sensei would exclaim: <i>“Here comes Trouble.”</i> For over a decade, that’s what everyone called Robert: Trouble. </p>

<img src="../images/ch 9 robert sensei me.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Trouble, Sensei, and myself</div>


<p class='left'>One night Robert was paired up with Patty Lipsett. They were doing kicking exercises as they raised their knees to block. Trouble did a roundhouse, which Patty blocked with her knee. He yelled. What was that? He had kicked into one of Patty’s knee braces. She answered: “steel“. There was more to Patty that was steel than her knee braces and she helped temper Robert into a martial artist.</p>
<p class='left'>Going to a karate class where everyone, but Trouble, was an adult and was, actually, pretty hard-core.  Everyone trained seriously and expected Robert (ah, Trouble) to have the same attitude. Robert gravitated to sparing. Because he sparred adults, he never learned to pull punches and kicks. He didn’t have to, he was maybe seventy pounds and his opponents were blue collar hard working, muscular, hard fighting men.</p>
<p class='left'>My father was, at one point, called to Robert’s elementary school. Bullying is a big subject today. But, at Robert’s elementary school, there was no bullying. You see, that school had Batman prowling at recess. Robert was somewhat small for his age and there were big kids of upper grades in the school yard. But a ninety or one-hundred pound elementary school bully was small to Trouble who was used to trading blows with hardcore men that were close to two-hundred pounds. </p>
<p class='left'>Robert regularly attended tournaments with me. His kata was very good and he regularly won. But his kumite was amazing. His opponents were from schools where classes had been tailored for children. His competitors just weren’t ready for Trouble. </p>
<p class='left'>The problem with Robert training essentially full-contact was that he didn’t stay small forever. He trained regularly at Lindquist’s dojo until he was seventeen or eighteen. At that point he was (based on my one-eighty or so) still small at one-sixty but he was six foot and very strong. It got so the only karateka that would spar Robert were the fanatical black belt trainees like Bretz, Kotzman and myself. Oh, and A.J. </p>
<p class='left'>It was easy to see that AJ loved Robert. He paired up with him regularly during class and they often sparred. I remember a group canoe trip down the Susquehanna River. One canoe was filled with AJ and a friend and the other canoe was for myself, Robert, and a weight lifter friend. At one point my friend got so fed up with Robert’s shenanigans and rude behavior that he threw him overboard. We left him stranded in the middle of a mile wide river. That’s the kind of brother I was. Tough love. (He was wearing a life preserver and was a solid swimmer.) A half-an-hour or so later A.J.’s canoe caught up with us and A.J. said: “Look what I found in the river.” Robert was beaming as he sat comfortably in A.J.’s canoe. </p>
<p class='left'>As an adult, Robert got a reputation at his blue collar job and he'd have two hundred twenty pound (Robert was about one-sixty) ex football player types challenge him. So Robert had several "Clint Eastwood" (from the Every Which Way but Loose movies) matches in parking lots. It was fists only (which was good for his opponents as Roberts kicks were pretty damn good.) Today, at fifty-some Robert is embarrassed about those matches because he now realizes he completely demoralized those guys.</p>
<p class='left'>Robert was, in many ways, trouble. He got expelled from high school at a time where his mother was President of the state school board. Understand that school officials had to go to the school board for approval to expel Robert. But Robert, in many ways, was far above any trouble he may have caused. After a year off school, he enrolled in a vocational technical high school and excelled. He ended up president of his class. He competed in cabinet making competitions and won state level competitions. In his forties Robert was laid off from his job on the plant floor so he went back to school and got an MBA. Today he’s the plant manager at the company he was laid off from but now is reemployed at triple his original salary.</p>
<p class='left'>Robert recently spoke to me of one of his stronger memories of Ralph:</p>


<i>“At the end of class, right after meditation (which was tough for hyperactive kid) Sensei clapped his hands and said: ‘It’s not the doing but the sharing of the doing that brings the true essence of being.’”</i>


<p class='left'>That’s a powerful quote for a nine year old to remember throughout their life. </p>


<h2>Patty Lipsett</h2>

<p class='left'>When I visualize the hundreds of classes I attended at the Harrisburg YMCA dojo, there was always the same student in the back of class: Patty Lipsett. Patty is a tall lady and her brother, Jack, attended classes regularly as well. Both earned brown belts. Patty had bad knees. She wore braces on both knees. I recall that, almost in every other class, one of Patty’s knees would pop out. Dave Bretz and I would continue leading class but Ralph, who was typically in the back, would stop and help Patty get her knee back in place. I recently asked Patty how painful that was and how she had dealt with it for decades. She responded: </p>

<i>“When you love doing something, pain is a little thing. I remember Sensei and AJ playing tug of war, with me as the rope, just to put my knee back in.  One week the left knee,  next week, the right knee. One night AJ picked me up , threw me over his shoulder and carried me out. God he had a bony shoulder.”</i>


<p class='left'><i>“I remember Sensei stepping over me, completing the exercise. Once done, he asked how I  was.”</i></p>


<p class='left'>N<i>“o pity, just a normal thing for me. Sometimes I walked out and sometimes I needed help.”</i></p>
<p class='left'><i>“One night AJ and Carol took me to their trailer. Fed me 6 shots of Yukon Jack. I felt no pain the rest of the night, and drove myself home.”</i></p>


<p class='left'><i>“Bad knees or not, Patty, at maybe five foot ten, was a stalwart fighter. She was tenacious. She had great punches and her kicks, despite bad knees, were dangerous. I inadvertently gave her a black eye one night as she was pushing me pretty hard. Ralph, who was extremely close to Patty, admonished me about that black eye saying he never wanted to see that again. Patty later explained to Sensei that she was pressing me and had walked into a punch.”</i></p>

<h2>Tim Messersmith and Don Pickel</h2>

<img src="../images/ch 9 messersmith_sheffield.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Tim Messersmith training Sheffield on kicking technique</div>

<p class='left'>I often dragged two other York guys to Lindquist class: Tim Messersmith and Don PIckel. Both obtained black belts from Ralph Lindquist. </p>
<p class='left'>Messersmith also started training under Charles Miller. When I was tested for brown belt, Messersmith and Vito Coviello were sitting outside drinking Coors watching the test through the window. This was in the seventies when Coors couldn’t go over the Colorado state line. But Messersmith had been competing in a conversion van competition in Colorado and, like Burt Reynolds in Smokey and the Bandit, brought a truckload back east. Tim was a small but very strong man. He’d regularly drive his custom van to Ralph’s class. Tim was a perfectionist that had been a competitive motorcyclist before Karate. He regularly won black belt kata in tournaments. In his sixties, TIm became an international level competitor in mountain biking.</p>

<img src="../images/ch 9 pickle blackbelt..jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Jim Kotzman, myself, Don Pickle, and Sensei</div>

<p class='left'>Don Pickel was my training partner at a time, due to family and career, neither of us was able to get to class three to four times a week. He would come to my house at 6 AM and we’d train in my basement before work. At that point Ralph would come down to York for Saturday classes, so Pickel had the advantage of Lindquist training as well.</p>




<h2>Family</h2>



<img src="../images/ch 9 dad trouble jim, me Sensei.jpg" class="center"/>
<div class="caption">Dr. Dad, Robert, Jim, Myself with Sensei kneeling: White, Green, Brown, Black, and, Master</div>


<p class='left'>Robert was family and Jim Kotzman became family. But those two weren’t the only members of the Denoncourt family that frequented Ralph Lindquist’s class. My older brother, Butch, was in the Navy and, when he was on leave, he’d come up to the Harrisburg class with us. He loved the intense workouts. Butch, oddly, recalls practicing blocks in the shower with Sensei. They had gotten into a discussion about blocking techniques and it turned into practice. My sisters Beth and Carol also came to class for a time. But it was my father who attended class long enough to obtain a green belt. My father had a PhD in Biology and Sensei Lindquist (who often called me D) respectfully called my father Doctor D. Of course that meant that everyone called my dad Doctor D. That name of respect became so regularly used that, at class, I called him Doctor Dad.</p>

<h2>Money Schools</h2>

<p class='left'>Many of our contemporaries from other dojos, once they achieved the level I, Bretz, and Kotzman did, opened up what I call money schools. Dojos where job one was to generate revenue. But our sensei did not embrace the money school philosophy. Consider that the Japanese word, dojo, means hall or place for immersive learning or meditation. And know that Okinawan karate, for centuries, was taught in hallways or outdoors. So the concept of a money school doesn’t seem to make sense.</p>
