  <h1>Chapter 6: A Lindquist Workout in the 70s</h1>
</center>

<p class='left'>A weightlifter friend heard I drove a half-hour from York to Harrisburg several times a week to train under Ralph Lindquist. He was flabbergasted. He asked me: <i>“With someone like Gary Brooks right here in York, why would you drive all that way to Harrisburg.”</i> I didn’t directly answer his question, opting not to tell him the Ralph Lindquist story. This guy didn’t know it, but I had trained under Gary Brooks. I had been going to Gary’s dojo on Eberts lane for most Saturdays from when I was between fourteen and fifteen years old. I continued to train with Brooks black belt students for years. Brooks was Shotokan and I had also trained under some of York’s best Tae Kwon Do instructors (Ed Costigan, Bill Sprenkle, and Ed Schmidt) when I was between sixteen and nineteen. Ralph Lindquist was cut from a different cloth than these instructors. They taught me how to kick, punch, and fight. Ralph taught me how to be a man — as well as how to be a standout martial artist. Note that Ralph asked Gary Brooks to be on my black belt test board. Gary was a big man who loved to drink beer after karate class and enjoyed a good bar fight. Those fights took their toll as, among other ailments, he eventually lost his spleen. Yes, I did learn about fighting from Gary Brooks but I went to Lindquist’s dojo in Harrisburg to learn karatedo — the way of karate — from a  true master.</p>
<p class='left'>I was, for the most part, a kid back 1975 when I’d drive my Ford Falcon from York PA to Harrisburg once or twice a week for class. I was sixteen, in eleventh grade, and considered Karate my sport. This chapter is a recount of one of those classes.</p>
<p class='left'>The class was in a bar. Well, it was a failed bar that Lindquist bought, gutted, and lined it with mirrors and indoor/outdoor carpeting, and created an unforgettable karate dojo. Undoubtedly, as with most USA karate pioneers, Lindquist patterned classes after his own combat training. </p>
<p class='left'>I arrived at class early and there was a lot of chatter. But soon everyone got quiet as we realized sensei was sitting — Buddhist style — on his insteps in a meditative position. We each ran to a spot and knelt down. After everything was perfectly silent for a moment or so, Ralph clapped his hands and leapt to his feet in the sei-san front stance. We did the same (although some of us with the aid of our hands.) He put his feet together and bowed — which we all did, only we bowed much more deeply showing respect. (It would have been interesting to see what might have happened if someone had not have returned the bow!)</p>
<p class='left'>As always, Ralph began class with karate’s mainstay exercise of knuckle pushups. He did probably forty and we knew we’d do another three or four sets of forty or so before class was over. At that point a life-worn man in his late forties appeared in the door, took off his shoes and joined the group for his first karate class.</p>
<p class='left'>Sensei then led us through side to side squats — for leg strength and side kick flexibility. And then some squats on the balls of your feet. These “toe benders” were used to train those stubby things to get out of the way during front kicks and lessen the chance of breaking toes.</p>
<p class='left'>Sensei then dropped down on his back and led us through leg lifts — for abdominal strength. He popped up and ran around the class bouncing on top of various student’s abs. You learned to exhale! For brown belts, of which I was one,  Ralph would stop, bend down, and deliver a few sharp punches to our bellies. You had the option of grunting or a Kiai (verbal shout of spirit from the belly) on each strike.</p>
<p class='left'>Several times during the exercises the karate neophyte rushed outside to throw up. Sensei urged him to sit it out but the man said <i>“No. I need to do this.”</i> I became good friends with him in later years. He was A. J. Boyd, a hard working, ex-military, electrician for the Pennsylvania railroad. He was a functioning alcoholic that became sober through karate training. A dozen or so years later, A.J. earned his black belt.</p>

<p class='left'>After finishing a few more typical karate-style calisthenics, Sensei started one person drills. We did basic punches in deep horse stances (till our legs shook with pain.) Next he led us through a variety of kicks from a fighting stance. We usually did ten repetitions. Sensei admonished: <i>“The last three should always be your hardest.”</i> Most of us were getting out of breath and Sensei exhorted <i>“Get out the bad air and get in the good air.”</i> Proper breathing was an Okinawan karate standard that Ralph continually pressed.</p>

<h2>Ippon Kumite</h2>

<p class='left'>Sensei asked us to pair up and he demonstrated an ippon kumite (one step sparring) drill. Your partner threw a straight right to your chest and you were to block it and counter with your own right cross. Unfortunately, I somehow ended up with Joe Salzinger for a partner.</p>
<p class='left'>Salzinger had the forearms of Popeye from years of working at a loading dock. His father had been a professional boxer but Joe’d rather train with Sensei Lindquist. Joe was a Pennsylvania state policeman. He later retired after ten years (having qualified for continued health benefits) to become a blacksmith. He quit being a State Trooper mostly because he was so respected by coworkers that, whenever things were getting difficult, they’d put calls out for Joe. One time he arrested a guy with a prosthetic hook for a hand. To be nice, Joe didn’t cuff him, but the first chance this poor guy had he took a hooked swing at Joe. Joe reacted and his training may have saved his life. He later found out that this guy had taken other people out with the same right “hook".</p>
<p class='left'>I was to be the first to throw the offensive punch. I squared off and lobbed a punch that stopped an inch before Joe’s chest. Joe didn’t move. He asked <i>“Why would I block that?”</i> I lobbed another one with a bit more energy and, once again, Joe did nothing but sneer. <i>“Come on!”</i> he said. So I threw a punch that hit him lightly on his chest (which was built up from years of knuckle push-ups.) Joe just looked at me. I deepened my stance and threw one with my full 185 pounds behind it. My punch whacked him hard on the chest and he grunted <i>“That’s it. Do it again.”</i> I threw another, which he blocked and a quarter-second later cracked my own chest pulling the punch just after it smacked me — leaving a red mark and the promise of a bruise.</p>
<p class='left'>When it was my turn to do the counterpunch you can be damn well sure I blocked the hay makers Joe was throwing.</p>

<h2>Floor as a Heavy Bag</h2>

<p class='left'>Uh oh… everyone was going down for push ups. Oddly Sensei was not on his knuckles. He was on his palms in gym class style push ups. He leaned to one side holding himself up with one palmed hand. His other hand was in a fist cocked to the side of his ribs. He torched his body parallel to the floor and cracked the floor with his knuckled fist. I said crack in that I expected the cement floor to split wide open. My own strikes were more akin to tapping someone lightly on their shoulders to get their attention than cracking.</p>
<p class='left'>Years later my son’s friends would speak of me as the wall puncher after they saw me in our basement training by cracking a cement block divider wall with punches.</p>
<p class='left'>Jumping up from the “cement floor as a heavy bag” exercise, Sensei had us group up for Kata training. Belt ranks were based on learning the complex Isshinryu kata along with self defense and fighting skills. Groups of two or three would have one advanced student show others the next kata in their advancement. Sensei was big on kata saying: <i>“kata is fighting”</i>.</p>

<h2>The Flying Punch</h2>

<p class='left'>After about a half hour of kata we grouped for free fighting. Cool. We didn’t free fight that often as Sensei’s philosophy was <i>“train hard; fight easy”</i> A philosophy I discovered years later champion wrestling coaches used by working drills more than open wrestling. At the rough karate tournaments of the seventies Sensei Lindquist’s students always fared extremely well.</p>
<p class='left'>Sensei was feeling spunky as he asked Bill Dolinger to spar. A treat because Sensei, who was around fifty, did not spar that often. Dolinger was a big black belt. He was six foot two and built much like Joe Don Baker of the original Walking Tall. Bill did stand big and tall as Sensei circled him and made odd clucking noises with his tongue (a quirk that those who had spared Sensei over the years warned you about as it meant he was in the zone.) Bill exploded with one of his long powerful front kicks. Sensei took a slight side step and performed a ballerina style dance kick to the floor behind Bill’s back. With a one-eighty pirouette on that dance kick’s toe, Sensei was completely behind Bill. He grabbed the nape of Bill’s gi top, stepped on Bill’s right hip, pulled himself up and began whacking the back of Bill’s head with punches. Watching, to me it looked like Bill didn’t know where Sensei disappeared and he didn’t much like getting whacked behind his head.</p>
<p class='left'>Sensei dropped back to his feet and Bill turned to face his assailant. Bill stood up with his feet together, bowed and said <i>“thank you.”</i> Thank you for showing me a weakness in my defense, that is. Kind of a Zen of Tennis sort of thing.</p>
<p class='left'>Bill dropped back into a fighting stance clearly ready for anything. Only he wasn’t. Sensei leaped off both feet and sailed through the air a bit higher than Bill’s head. Sensei was pretty much in an impenetrable ball. His left elbow was touching his left knee, which was raised up high. Bill put both hands up to block this flying menace. But Sensei’s lead left hand slapped Bill’s lead blocking away as he torched his right hip and knee forward as he delivered a cement floor crackable punch to Bill’s face. As sensei landed back on his feet, Bill had a beaming smile. He was on the receiving end of greatness. He was six foot two fighting a man five-two who was coming down from above on him.</p>
<p class='left'>I’ll tell you. I didn’t see such technique again until the Star Wars movies came out with Yoda’s flying fight sequences.</p>
<p class='left'>I loved that flying punch. I’d train by laying chairs down and repeatedly leap over them and perform the punch. I used it effectively against some of the best local talent in black belt level competition. In the twenty-first century MMA fighters began calling this the superman punch but Ralph Lindquist was doing it in the nineteen-sixties and I used it in the seventies and eighties.</p>

<p class='left'>Just then Dave Bretz tapped my shoulder and asked to spar. Dave was only a green belt but he was a football and wrestling standout that was into bodybuilding. His gis was tight on his arms. He was twenty-two and I was sixteen. But I was a brown belt and my kicks were spot on. I’d watch Bruce Lee movies and drill kicks every night in my parent’s basement. At parties I’d show off by kicking cigarettes out of mouths and hats off heads. I threw some flashy kicks at Dave’s head but he waded inside these flashy nuisances pushing my kicking knee aside with his lead hand while whacking my ribs with a resounding reverse punch. I went home regularly with bruises on my torso and face from this, so called, no contact karate.</p>

<h2>Breath</h2>

<p class='left'>Simultaneously, everyone noticed Sensei kneeling in the Samurai position at the front of class. We ran to our original class starting positions and knelt down ourselves. Sensei seemed to be having an out of body experience. He was breathing deep meditative breaths, his hands were in the standard Nichiren buddhist palmed position (like you are holding an egg, Ralph would explain.) After maybe a minute, or two (it's hard to say, after a hard class this mediation period was like sitting in cool shade drinking ice water) Ralph leaped up to seisan stance and bowed and said: <i>“Thank you.”</i> We also bowed responding: <i>“Thank you, Sensei.”</i></p>
