  <h1>Chapter 4: Tatsuo and the Ronin</h1>

<p class='left'>Karate’s origins are from China. Bodhidharma was a buddhist monk who was having issues with students falling asleep during meditation and who were also regularly besieged by highwaymen. Bodhidharma created choreographed routines of kung-fu self-defense exercises that we now call Kata. Kung Fu migrated to Okinawa in the thirteenth century. Originally, karate meant Kara-chinese, Te-hand, or Chinese Hand. Centuries later the symbol for karate was modified to signify empty hand. </p>
<p class='left'>With centuries of adaptation, the original kung fu style was unrecognizable. Of significant importance to the development of karate in Okinawa was that Japan controlled and occupied Okinawa and forbade Okinawans from owning or using weapons. After 300 years of Japanese occupation, through generations of clandestine training, the Okinawans became quite good at this empty hand fighting thing. </p>
<p class='left'>Many folk wrongly believe Karate came from Japan. Actually Karate migrated from Okinawa to Japan in the early 1900s by Gichin Funakosi. </p>
<p class='left'>One of the foremost champions of Okinawan Karate in the 1930s and 40s was Shimabuku Tatsuo. Shimabuku trained under four of Okinawa’s most well regarded masters: Miyagi, Kyan, Motobu, and Taira. These are four names you are not apt to be familiar with… except for Miyagi. If you ever watched the movie The Karate Kid you know his instructor’s name was Mr. Miyagi. The screenwriters got that name from Okinawan karate history. In fact, the kata the kid did in the movies was seiuchin -- which is from the Goju-ryu system that Miyagi founded.</p>
<p class='left'>Shimabuku was such a renowned fighter and instructor that Japan designated him as the hand-to-hand combat trainer for the Japanese Royal Marines. Shimabuku continued to refine the effectiveness of kata through his real world training of Japanese special forces (and later American marines.)</p>
<p class='left'>In 1956 Shimabuku introduced a new style called Isshinryu. Isshinryu incorporated the best of the various styles Tatsuo had studied and mastered. Shimabuku was religious. He was not a priest, but he was deeply religious. The translation of Isshinryu is: school of one heart one mind. Tatsuo incorporated eight codes that all students of Isshinryu had to memorize.</p>

<ol>
  <li>A person’s heart is the same as Heaven and Earth.</li>
  <li>The Blood circulating is similar to the Moon and the Sun.</li>
  <li>A manner of drinking and spitting is either hard or soft.</li>
  <li>A person’s unbalance is the same as a weight.</li>
  <li>The body should be able to change motion at any time.</li>
  <li>The time to strike is when opportunity presents itself.</li>
  <li>The eye must see in every ways.</li>
  <li>The ear must listen in all directions.</li>
</ol>

<p class='left'>I believe these eight codes are arguably similar to Buddhism's Eightfold Path. Regardless, with study and consideration, the Isshinryu code defines a good strategy for life. Ralph Lindquist, although a Buddhist priest, required his students to learn the Isshinryu code but rarely spoke of the eightfold path (which was obviously near and dear to his religious belief.)</p>
<p class='left'>After hundreds of years of Japanese occupation, post world war two, Okinawa was occupied by American forces. In 1957 Shimabuku began training a small number of American Marines. The first were Don Nagle, Harold Long, Richard Keith, and Harry Smith. One part of Tatsuo’s innovative training was that he’d have his students fight full contact as they wore Kendo armour. Richard Keith and Harry Smith trained together at Tatsuo’s Okinawan school for almost two years.</p>
<h2>Harry Smith: Ronin</h2>
<p class='left'>Tatsuo spoke almost no English and he called Harry Smith “Ronin.” He couldn’t have been more accurate with that name. Ronin means a wandering samurai that has no master. </p>
<p class='left'>For decades, Harry Smith performed covert operations for the federal government. This began when Harry, as a young man, chased down a hit and run driver. He ran him off the road, subdued him, stuffed him into his trunk, and drove to the local police office. When police asked if he could identify the driver, Harry showed them the contents of his trunk. Word got out to the military who talked Harry into entering the marines and then asked him to work undercover to expose suspected illicit activities of a military training officer. Harry ended up loving the marines. But this covert relationship with the federal government went on for decades. He was involved with, among other things, the Bay of Pigs. Harry also, for several years, was a mercenary working for the famous Mad Mike Hoare (known as the Wild Geese) in Africa.</p>
<p class='left'>Harry was regularly thrown in jail. It was his practice, when incarcerated, to start a fight -- just to get put in solitary confinement. He confided to Ralph Lindquist that he wanted to be in solitary because he was afraid he might otherwise kill someone. </p>
<p class='left'>At one point Harry Smith told one of his students, George Dilman: <i>“If you ever get into trouble, rob a bank so you go to a federal prison. Then I can get you out.”</i> Ralph Lindquist told me that Harry experienced scenarios where he’d be in a local prison then he’d do something to get transferred to a federal institution. Next, he’d be out of the country for months (doing we don’t know what) and he’d come back a free citizen. In one scenario Harry was incarcerated for putting six cops in the hospital. In another, a man pulled a gun on him in a bar. Without a thought, Harry punched him in the jaw, killing him instantly.</p>
<p class='left'>It is my belief that these early Isshinryu sensei (Long, Nagle, Keith, and Smith) gleaned the very best Tatsuo had to offer. They trained under Tatsuo just as the Isshinryu style was introduced and before it was taken over by Tatsuo’s family.</p>
